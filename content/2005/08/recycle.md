I've been progressively cleaning my room for the past couple days -- tackling a different section each day. Yesterday I got rid of 4 old computers that hadn't worked for years, plus an old laptop that was probably almost as old as I am. I've recycled thousands of pieces of paper and shredded at least that much.

There sure is a whole lot of junk in here.
