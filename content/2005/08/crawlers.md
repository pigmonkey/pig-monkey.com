I've just finished reading <a href="http://www.darkecho.com/JohnShirley/" >John Shirley</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345446526/" >Crawlers</a>. I picked it up expecting it to be a cyberpunk book, but it turned out to be more horror than anything else. It takes about 200 pages to get actually get into the book, but I ended up enjoying it. It reminds me a lot of some of <a href="http://darkatlas.com/" >Sean Kennedy</a>'s fiction.
