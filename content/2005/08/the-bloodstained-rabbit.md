I've just finished reading Sean Kennedy's <a href="http://www.darkatlas.com/writing-rabbit.php" >The Bloodstained Rabbit</a>. I should probably start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the horror genre -- in fact this is probably the first real horror novel I've read. That said, I liked the book. A lot.

I don't think it was so much of a horror book as it was a thriller. (Although it has all the makings of a good horror: nazis, the occult, lots of gore, interdimensional beings, etc.) Sean did a great job with keeping you tense (the scene with the Indian hunting party....I burned through that a sentence a second because of the suspense).

It could have used more editing, though. There were plenty of obvious typos that probably would have been fixed if one more pair of eyes had looked it over before printing.
