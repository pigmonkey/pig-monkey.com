Last week, while I was looking for something I could put on my poop at MutantFest to help break it down, I discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Tree_Oil" >Tea Tree Oil</a>. I've been using it in my toothpaste for a while, but never really realized what the stuff was.

It's a <a href="http://fiascofarm.com/herbs/teatree.htm" >first aid kit in a bottle</a>. <a href="http://www.teatreeplace.com/" >Here</a> is a list of some of it's uses:

> Tea Tree Oil is a natural antiseptic, germicide, antibacterial, fungicide. Many people use tea tree oil for: athletes foot, cold and flu, oral thrush, cold sores & canker sores, tooth ache & gum infections, ringworm, candida, head lice or louse, cleanser additive, gum problems, mosquito bites, bug repellent, cockroaches, deter flees, mouth ulcers, herpes, cuts, abrasions, after shave, sunburn, anorectal or vaginal yeast infections, unwanted body odors, acne, toe nail infections, and many other uses.

The first day of MutantFest, Tina managed to acquire a bug bite above her eyebrow about the size of a quarter. It was huge. When we got back to camp, she put a couple drops of my tea tree oil on it and, after a couple hours, it was practically gone. I also used it as a bug repellent, since I hate putting that Raid stuff on my skin.

I highly recommend picking up a bottle.
