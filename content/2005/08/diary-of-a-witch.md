Last night I completed reading Sybil Leek's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0132085208/qid=1124822591/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8667744-3813757?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Diary of a Witch</a>. Although I'm not a fan of Sybil's writing style, the book is very interesting. It's part biography, part rant. She covers everything from her time living gypsies in New Forest to her thoughts on reincarnation.
