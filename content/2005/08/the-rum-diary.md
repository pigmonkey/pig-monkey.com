During MutantFest, I finished reading Hunter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684856476/qid=1123905521/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8667744-3813757?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >The Rum Diary</a>. It's your typical Hunter Thompson book, but with rum instead of drugs.

A whole lot of rum.
