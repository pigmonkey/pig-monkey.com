I saw a headline in the newspaper today (I think it was the Herald): Constitution Likely to Settle Governors Race.
<i>Likely</i>? Isn't the constitution supposed to settle everything? Isn't that the whole idea of America? Isn't that why we pay a bunch of old farts to sit around and feel important all day?

Some days...
