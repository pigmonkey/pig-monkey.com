I've started listening to <a href="http://www.binrev.com/radio/" >BinRev radio again</a>. Yeah, I stopped a while back. There's so much radio out there nowadays that it just sorta got shoved to the back burner. So now I'm on episode 76, which was aired in 2004. Depressing.

I need to get back on the forums, too.
