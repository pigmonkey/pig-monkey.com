Thanks to <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&threadid=299166" >this post</a> on LQ, I discovered that Firefox and Thunderbird have been added to <a href="http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-current/" >slackware-current</a>. Sweetness. Now I just hope that the next version ships with 2.6 as default so I don't have to upgrade whenever I install.
