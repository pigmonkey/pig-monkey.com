Slug: signal-to-noise

Today I finished reading Eric S. Nylund's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380792923/qid=1110655010/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8126296-6853733?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Signal to Noise</a>. I've had somewhat of a love-hate relationship with the book, but, in the end, love prevails and I'd recommend it to any cyberpunk fan.
Although it's not your average cyberpunk. I think of cyberpunk as generally being placed in a sci-fi setting, but not focusing much on the actual science fiction. And, of course, cyberpunk has your post-apocalyptic/dystopia themes, too. Signal to Noise is leaning more toward normal science fiction -- they have aliens! -- and ends with the apocalypse, instead of taking place in it.
It ends in a cliff-hanger, too. Bastard.

All in all, a good book. I think Eric Nylund spent a <i>tad</i> too long at Microsoft, though. The whole book revolves around corporations and business.
