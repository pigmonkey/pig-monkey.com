A few weeks ago I finished reading Timothy Leary's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1579510310/qid=1110599074/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-4735198-2617500?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >The Politics of Ecstasy</a>. It's an ok book. Less attention on the philosophical/mystical side of the psychedelic experience, and more on the real-world stuff. You know, politics.
