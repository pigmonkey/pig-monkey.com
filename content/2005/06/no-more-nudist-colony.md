<blockquote>
Well folks, to begin with lets talk about the location. 

We are moving the Festival back to Klickitat County. The space is about 2
hours from Portland and 3 hours from Seattle.

We moved out of Lake Bronson after an 11th hour issue with the contract and
also because we came across a piece of land in Klickitat that is much more
suited to the needs of the festival.

We are very excited about this new land because it has never been used, it
is almost centrally located between Portland and Seattle, it is extremely
secluded, has a wide variety of topographical features and is quite large.
And really, it just has that Phoenix Festival feel. Something we were
starting to think Lake Bronson would not be able to provide.

Needless to say, we are quite eatstatic over the new location!</blockquote>


To tell you the truth, I'm a little sad. I was looking forward to the nudist colony. I mean, how many people get to go to a nudist colony (with a good excuse)?
