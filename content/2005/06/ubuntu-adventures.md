I changed my mail client from Ubuntu's default Evolution back to Thunderbird. Evolution was really nice when it worked -- but that was rare. It would always disconnect from the IMAP server and do all sorts of funky things. One would think that the software would improve after being bought by a big corporation like Novell. Oh well.
