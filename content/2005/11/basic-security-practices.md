<blockquote>As a government employee, you've heard it all before * lock your computer screen, protect your computer password, shred unwanted government documents, be careful about what is discussed in unclassified phone calls and e-mails, and practice vigilance in all matters related to workplace security.</blockquote>

Government employee? These are the bare essentials that any one who's in contact with technology for more than 10 minutes a month should practice. Of course, you'd replace "shred unwanted government documents" with "shred everything but the newspaper", "unclassified phone calls and e-mails" with "anything that isn't encrypted with a 2048 bit key", and "workplace security" with "personal security".
