I spent a good hour trying to figure out how to get Wordpress excerpts to work decently only to find there's a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More" >more</a> button in the Quicktag bar that does exactly what I want. Oops.

I need to check the Codex before Google next time.
