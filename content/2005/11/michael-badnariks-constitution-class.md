For the past couple weeks, I've been watching <a href="http://www.badnarik.org/" >Michael Badnarik</a>'s 8 hour <a href="http://www.constitutionpreservation.org/" >Constitution Class</a> available on <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Michael_Badnarik" >archive.org</a>. It's an excellent video series that introduces you to the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights -- what it says, and how the government has bastardized it. He focuses on privileges vs. rights, property, the legality of the IRS and Federal Reserve, inflation and deflation. I'm not even a Libertarian (although I agree with him on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Badnarik#Issue_positions" >more than one issue</a>) and I'm giving two thumbs up.

Go. Watch it.
