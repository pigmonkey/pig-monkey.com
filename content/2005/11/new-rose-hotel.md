I've finally watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133122/" >New Rose Hotel</a>, the movie based on William Gibson's short story of the same name. It's a really good movie and even manages to compare to the short story, although it really isn't Cyberpunk. I don't know why it isn't more popular with the masses.
