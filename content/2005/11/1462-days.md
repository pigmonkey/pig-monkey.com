As of this very minute, my blog has been running for 1,462 days (4 years and 2 days). That is, my blog has been running on some sort of automated software for that long (blogger.com lead to b2/cafelog which lead to wordpress). If you count updates via static html, you can add another couple years onto that count.

(I find this interesing.)
