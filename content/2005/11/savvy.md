Today, I went down to <a href="http://www.savvytraveleredmonds.com/" >The Savvy Traveler</a> in Edmonds to attend a <a href="http://www.savvytraveleredmonds.com/Imports/Seminars.asp#24" >seminar on Thailand</a>.
It ended up being a bunch of old people talking about 4-star hotels, which was slightly depressing, but they mentioned what sounded like a few interesting places to visit, so it wasn't a total loss.
