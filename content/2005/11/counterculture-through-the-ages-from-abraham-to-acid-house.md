I've finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._U._Sirius" >R. U.</a> Sirius' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375507582/103-0576156-4515824?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance" >Counterculture Through the Ages: From Abraham to Acid House</a>, as per recommendation of <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com" >Douglas Rushkoff</a>. It's an excellent book, which covers, as the title suggests, counterculture from the early counterculture of Socrates, Tao and Zen to the Enlightenment, Transcendentalism, Beats, Hippies, Punks, Hackers, Ravers, and even mentions S.P.A.Z.. The second part of the book (it's split into three parts -- defining counterculture, pre and post Hiroshima) reads more or less as a condensed history of the Western world.
