Today was the last day of medic training. We went over athletic injuries, fractures, splinting, dislocations, heat and cold injuries, lightning, anaphylaxis, and altitude illness.

Overall the course was designed for expedition leaders and guides. It focused on what was wrong with the patient, deciding if it could be easily fixed, and, if not, maintaining the patient until they could be evacuated. So there wasn't a huge amount of healing involved, but I think I can stop most people from dying.

It ended up being worth the money. Next year, I think I might go for <a href="http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wildfirstresponder.shtml" >wilderness first responder</a>.
