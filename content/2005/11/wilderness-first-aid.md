Today was day 1 of my <a href="http://www.nols.edu/wmi/index.shtml" >Wilderness Medicine Institute</a> <a href="http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wildfirstaid.shtml" >Wilderness First Aid</a> course. It's a pretty good course. We went over patient assessment, spinal injury, head wounds, shock, and wild wounds.

Next time I fall off a cliff, I'll be able to see if my spine is broken.
