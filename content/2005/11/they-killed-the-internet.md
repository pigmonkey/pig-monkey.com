It seems <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/" >Western</a>'s proxy is down, or something else is preventing me from accessing the internet without going through Tor.

<b>Update</b>: Apparently the problem was thus: "An upgrade of a piece of equipment, during which the netmask was incorrectly defined in such a way that certain IP addresses (for example google, yahoo) were thought to be on the local network (i.e. No Route to Host as people saw)."
