I seem to have acquired a cold, so I decided that this was the perfect time to try the random drugs I picked up on a street corner in a nondescript brown paper envelope.

Ok, so it was a street corner -- it was red square. And the women who gave it to me was wearing a lab coat (at least she <i>looked</i> like a doctor).
They're supposed to be a homeopathic cold remedy. The envelope says it includes Echinacea, Calendula, and Chelidonium. We'll see if it works.
