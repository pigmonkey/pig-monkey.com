I have all my backups restored and most additional software installed, but I'm still having two rather large problems. One, <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=412903" >the Firestarter tray icon will not launch at login</a> and two, <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=414945" >running SSH via Startup Programs is broken</a>.
All in all, I'm not as impressed with 5.10 as I thought I would be -- it does feel <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=76449">a little rushed</a>. That said, there are many improvements over 5.04 and none of the problems I'm experiencing are enough to make me pop the Slackware disc back in.

If you're currently running 5.04, I'd recommend holding off upgrading for a few weeks till some patches come out.
