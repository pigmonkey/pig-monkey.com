I've finally finished reading Naomi Klein's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312421435/qid=1128292939/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8667744-3813757?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >No Logo</a>. It's been on my bookshelf for over a year, and I've been reading it for about a month. For some reason it was really slow reading for me, but overall it is a good book -- if slightly dated (pre Seattle and pree 9/11).

It can be summed up in a few statements:

	1) Modern advertising = evil
	2) Corporate outsourcing = evil
	3) Reclaim the Streets, Adbusting, Culture Jamming = Good
