Paypal, for no apparent reason, suspended my account last Sunday:
<blockquote>As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the
PayPal system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account:

understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.

For your protection, we have limited access to your account until
additional security measures can be completed. We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause.

I had to change my password, change my secret questions, and confirm my street address (which involved waiting till Thursday for snail-mail). My account is back to normal now, but they're still bastards.
