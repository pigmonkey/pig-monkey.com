I went into <a href="http://www.pearlevision.com/" >Pearle Vision</a> today. When I was walking around the store, I accidentally bumped one of the computers. And what did I see? The XScreenSaver password prompt! Yes, Pearle Vision is running Linux. And not just in the backroom, these were the actual workstations out in the showroom. Cool stuff.
