Title: Too much damn data

I've finally finished cleaning and organizing all my data on my computer and started transferring it over to my laptop. My laptop's 100GB hard drive now only has 15G free, and I still have roughly another 100GB that hasn't been transfered yet.
I think I'm going to buy a new 200GB hard drive and stick it in an external usb 2.0 enclosure I have. That should give me a little room to grow.
