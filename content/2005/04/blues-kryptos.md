I watched Blue's Clues yesterday.
Apparently throughout the show you find 3 clues, left by Blue, and at the end put them all together to form some sort of game that Blue wants to play with you.
The clues yesterday were water, a hose, and a ladder.

I was stumped.

It ended up that Blue wanted to play firefighters with me, but damn-- kids these days must be smart. I might have gotten it if they had added in a helmet. Or a person.

In a few years Blue will probably have these kids solving Kryptos.
