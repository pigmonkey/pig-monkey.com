<blockquote>Freetekno is a cultural movement present in Europe and North America. Freetekno soundsystems or tribes form in loose collectives, frequently with anarchist philosophies. The soundsystems gather in warehouses, fields, abandoned buildings, forests, or anywhere else that a party can be rocked. Freetekno parties are often held on abandoned private property or in city centers. This sometimes leads to clashes with the police, as was the case at the 2004 Czechtek festival, and many smaller parties all around the world at various times.</blockquote>
