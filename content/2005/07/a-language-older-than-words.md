Today I finished reading <a href="http://www.derrickjensen.org/" >Derrick Jensen</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1931498555/qid=1121622613/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8667744-3813757?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >A Language Older Than Words</a>. I'm not sure what to say about it, other than it's the best book I've yet to read.

Go. Read it.
