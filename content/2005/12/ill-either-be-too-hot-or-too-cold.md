Tomorrow morning is my snowshoeing trip.

From what people have been telling me, it's a whole lot of work -- should be interesting. 

I packed by bag tonight and I have a feeling it's going to get really heavy after the first hour or so, but most of the weight is water, so there's not much I can do about it, save drink.

What I'm wearing:
1. Wigwam INgenius hiker socks
2. ECWCS polypropylene long underwear
3. UnderArmour ColdGear mock-t
4. Acrylic watch cap
5. Polarmax zip mock-t
6. Normal cargo pants
7. 5.11 HRT Waterproof boots
8. Best Defense ECWCS GORE-TEX Pants
9. Normal snow jacket
10. Patagonia Lightweight Capilene Glove Liner
11. Blackhawk Hellstorm ECW gloves
12. Patagonia Neck Gator

Everything in layers. Everything but the pants are moisture-wicking, synthetic fibers.
