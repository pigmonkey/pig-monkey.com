What's with all the to do about the NSA leaving cookies? It was fun to watch the story grow from <span class="removed_link">a small post on Google Watch</span> all the way to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/29/national/29cookies.html?oref=login&pagewanted=print" >the NY Times</a>, but, really, is it a story? There are very few websites that don't cookie their users. And let's not forget who this story concerns -- as R. A. Hettinga said on the Cypherpunks list: "Exactly what part of "spook" do people not understand at this stage?"

I wonder if this would have made it any further than Google Watch had the NSA not previously been in the news.

Please, folks, tell Firefox to ask you every time a website tries to cookie you, and deny it most every time. Particularly when you're visiting government sites.
