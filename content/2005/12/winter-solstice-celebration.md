I went to the <a href="http://www.seattlecenter.com/news/news_detail.asp?ME_MediaNum=736" >Winter Solstice Celebration</a> in Seattle Center today (I don't know why they couldn't get the date right). The fire dancing wasn't very impressive. There was one person with a flaming sword, which was cool, but, other than that, they just spinned staffs around their heads and had poorly synchronized drummers.
But, the <a href="http://worldmeditationensemble.com/" >World Meditation Ensemble</a> were cool and I got fudge, so it was worth it.
