<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112682/" >The City of Lost Children</a> is a cyberpunk film about a mad scientist who kidnaps children to steal their dreams, in hopes of slowing his aging. It's French, and it's excellent. In fact, if it wasn't for the drugs, strippers, and murder, it would be a good children's film. Go watch it.
