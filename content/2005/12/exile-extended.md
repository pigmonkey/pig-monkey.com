While it's a little too 1980s sounding for my taste, Gary Numan's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_%28Gary_Numan_album%29" >Exile Extended</a> isn't a bad album. It's a something of a industrial-goth-rock thing. Sort of Blade Runner, sort of The Cure, sort of Billy Idol's Cyberpunk. Most of the songs would be at home on The Crow soundtrack.

It's growing on me.
