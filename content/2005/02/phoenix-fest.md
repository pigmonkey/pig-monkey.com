Today I discovered <a href="http://www.phoenixfest.com" >Phoenix Fest</a>, another one of the <a href="http://burningman.com/" >Burning Man</a> rip-offs, but this one just 3 hours south.

<blockquote>In the re:evolutionary spirit of festivals such as Burning Man, Tribal Gathering, Woodstock 1 and Earthdance, PHOENIX FESTIVAL is an annual autonomous music and arts festival which takes place over "Independence Day" (4th of July) weekend in the scenic Pacific Northwest, USA.</blockquote>

Last year I discovered Mutant Fest, which Tina and I have been talking about going to this year.

So, if all goes to plan, I think we'll try to attend both Phoenix Fest and Mutant Fest this summer. Should be interesting.
