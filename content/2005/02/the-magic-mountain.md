I've just finished reading Thomas Mann's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679772871/qid=1109443464/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-3305630-3877456?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >The Magic Mountain</a>. One of the best books ever written, I'd say. Definitely deserved the Nobel Prize. It should be required reading for all Westerners.

I need to read it again.
