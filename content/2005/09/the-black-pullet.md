Today I finished reading <a href="http://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A//www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1578632021%3Fv%3Dglance&ei=PuIhQ7ecCprORvq2zMID" >The Black Pullet</a>, a book which discusses various amulets and rings that give the bearer power to become invisible, conjure spirits, punish their enemies -- you know, the usual. An entertaining read.
