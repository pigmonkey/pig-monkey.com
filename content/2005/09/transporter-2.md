I just got back from watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388482/" >Transporter 2</a>. It was good, but not as good as the first. The cool oil-slick-trick made a guest appearance, but there was nothing as neat as the two guys with the axes in the small hallway in the first movie.
The plot was predictable a tad predictable.

The new Doom trailer was sweet. I'm liking the first person view they're doing. Apparently it is more of a ride than a movie. I hope they have it at the <a href="http://cinerama.com/" >Cinerama</a>.

Speaking of trailers, there was one for some movie about a life-long gamer who moves in with his grandmother, or something like that. It's really depressing how mainstream geeks and gamers are. Most people in the movie seemed to be wearing Jinx t-shirts.
...I'm going to have to start finding even more obscure clothing.
