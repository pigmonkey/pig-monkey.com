The site was down today, as was all of Dreamhost, due to the <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Undergoing_Large_Power_Outage" >power outage in L.A.</a>

<blockquote>Serious electricity problems in the Los Angeles area have taken our entire network off-line.

The backup power for our data center initially failed, but is expected to be back up soon. Our technicians are waiting for the go ahead to start flipping switches. General power in the Los Angeles area is still out and we have no information about when it will be restored.</blockquote>
