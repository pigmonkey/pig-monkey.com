# PGP Key Signing

I will sign other keys according to the following policy.

## Casual (Level 2)

I have performed a casual check of the person and key, generally meaning that:

* I personally know the subject of the key by the UID, and have for some time;
* I can readily and reliably recognize them; and
* I verified their key fingerprint through an out-of-band channel, which might
  include voice or video chat.

## Extensive (Level 3)

I have performed an extensive check of the person and key, generally meaning that:

* I physically met the person, not by voice or video chat;
* they presented me with difficult to forge evidence of their identity;
* I verified their key fingerprint at that time; and
* I verified that the email address of the UID belongs to the person.


## Notes:

* I do not have a specific metric for how long I have to know someone before
  being willing to certify their key based solely on our relationship. I use my
  judgement and discretion.
* I do not require that the UIDs I certify are someone's birth name, or the
  name on their government documents. I will certify a persistent pseudonym if
  that is the name someone goes by.
* "[D]ifficult to forge evidence of... identity" often means government issued
  photo identification which I find convincing. It may also mean a personal
  attestation from someone who I know well and consider trustworthy.


# PGP Key Management

My private key was generated offline on an air-gapped computer. All key signing
occurs on an offline, air-gapped computer. The key and computer are stored
securely in a tamper-evident manner. Signing and encryption subkeys for regular
use are stored on a YubiKey NEO.
