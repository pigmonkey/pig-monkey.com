The <a href="http://www.kmmatchcase.com">K &amp; M Industries Match Case</a> has long been considered one of the top waterproof match cases available. Each case is hand made in the Elk River, Idaho garage of Keith and Marge Lunders.

The match cases are available in either brass or aluminum and come in two different sizes. The standard length cases are 3 7/8", designed to fit 2 3/8" strike-anywhere matches. The long length cases, measuring in at 4 1/4", are designed for <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/617046">REI Storm Proof Matches</a>. Aluminum cases are available in black, silver, green, or red.

Last winter, I bought a standard length, black aluminum case. It has been part of my wilderness EDC for close to a year.

Though I don't always use them, I always carry matches into the wilderness, in addition to at least one BIC lighter and a multitude of ferro rods. Ferro rods are my primary means of starting fire -- usually with some synthetic tinder, such as Vaseline soaked cotton balls. It's also my primary way of starting my alcohol stoves. If I'm not having luck with the rod, or all my tinder is wet, I can move to a lighter or a match to get the fire going. I've also found that when it gets to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit or below, denatured alcohol does not like to take a spark -- instead requiring a match or lighter to start my stove.

A lighter is of course the easiest way of starting a fire, but because I carry a BIC lighter, it is not always dependable. If it was submerged, it will need some time to dry out before working. If there are high winds, the flame will no doubt get blown out. I have previously carried waterproof, windproof butane lighters, but those seem to eat through the fuel way too fast to be practical wilderness devices. It is difficult to justify the huge price increase in one compared to a BIC lighter. The other problem with BIC lighters is that it can be hard to determine how much fuel you have left. You can judge the weight, shake it around next to your ear and listen, but it's a rough estimate at best. That's what I like about matches: you can count how many you have. For this simple reason, I am sometimes likely to go to my matches rather than my lighter when I need ready-made flame.

Carrying the aforementioned REI Storm Proof Matches also addresses some of the other concerns of the BIC lighter: they will light when wet (if lit and then submerged, they will quickly relight themselves after you remove them from the water) and are nigh impossible to blow out. This makes them a great emergency fire source, but, like the fancy butane lighters, are relatively expensive compared to standard strike-anywhere matches. Because of this, I carry both: normal strike-anywhere matches for general use and REI Storm Proof Matches for when the elements are against me. The REI Storm Proof Matches, being pretty darn waterproof, aren't in much need of a waterproof case (I imagine that they will get soggy and useless if they're kept underwater for a long period of time, but if you accidentally take a bath during a river crossing and crawl out within a couple minutes, the matches should be fine). Strike-anywhere matches, on the other hand, do need extra protection. Hence why I decided to start with the standard size K &amp; M case.

All K &amp; M match cases feature a unique closure system. The lid itself has two o-rings on it to prevent any water leakage (guaranteed to 2000 psi of water pressure). It's not a screw on lid, but simply pressed onto the case. After the lid is on, you then twist the cap, which in turn twists and tightens the thin nylon lanyard around the body of the case, ensuring that the fit remains tight. Ingenious, simple, and effective.

The body of the case itself is about 3" (not including the cap). The bottom half is smooth, while the top bit is etched with a pattern that ensures a good grip can be had on the case, even when you and it are soaked.

The top of the lid sports a small Suunto compass for general direction finding, greatly increasing the utility of the item. This isn't some cheap, $1 knock-off button compass, either. Suunto compasses can be depended upon.

The outer rim of the lid has been etched in the same manner as the top half of the body for grip, but the case also comes with a small protective piece of plastic that slides snugly over the lid, protecting the face of the compass. With this installed, you loose the extra grip on the lid. This may be a problem in some conditions.

The lanyard, after it does its thing tightening the lid, extends down past the body of the case for about 12", terminating in a loop, which allows the case to be securely fastened to your person.

The inside of the lid is roughened, which is supposed to provide a surface for striking the matches. Perhaps I don't know how to strike a match, but it's never worked for me. In fact, as a general rule, I find strike-anywhere matches to actually be strike-anywhere-there-is-a-commercial-match-striking-surface matches. I never have luck attempting to strike matches on any old rough surface. But that's not a problem: all REI Storm Proof Matches come with extra striking surfaces inside the box. They're pretty heavy duty, work with all types of matches, and come sealed in plastic. I tend to collect them and stash them everywhere. For the K &amp; M match case, I cut off a small piece that would fit on the bottom of the lid and super-glued it on. This guarantees me a working surface to strike my matches.

The rest of the striker I put back in it's plastic cover and store in the body of the case, for use as a backup. The plastic prevents it from striking and lighting any of the matches.

Because of the striking surface on the lid, I store all the matches tip down, so that they won't accidentally light and turn the case into a bomb. With the the extra striker stored, I can jam in about 25 matches, give or take a few. You could fit in more if you removed the striker. The match case is also a nice place to carry a pre-threaded needle or two for emergency repairs.

Around the outside of the case, I keep a length of that same 700x35 bicycle inner-tube that I have around my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/28/rubberized-bic-lighter/">BIC</a> and a couple of my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/29/rubberized-mora-handle/">Moras</a>. The inner-tube, along with matches that are guaranteed to be dry, gives me a sure-fire method of fire starting.

Both the brass and aluminum cases sell for $19 each. That may seem like a lot of money for a simple match case, particularly when you can pick up a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/678278">cheap-o plastic one for $1.75</a>, but I think it is well worth the money. The brass case looks a lot nicer and is more durable, but is a good deal heavier than the aluminum.

Some day I would like to acquire one of the long aluminum cases for my REI Storm Proof Matches, even though it is not strictly necessary.

I also own a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1935948125/">TAD Gear Life Capsule O.K.</a>, which makes a good match case. The TAD Capsule is equally waterproof and also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1935948151/">includes a compass in one end</a> (albeit a cheaper one), but because of the significantly increased weight of the TAD capsule over the K &amp; M case, I think the K &amp; M is a superior product.

Another review of the case, along with some discussion of matches, can be found at <a href="http://www.britishblades.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10196">British Blades</a>. I thought I remembered Schwert doing a review of the case on the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/11/14/outdoors-magazine-mirror/">now defunct Outdoors Magazine</a>, but I cannot find it in the archives.
