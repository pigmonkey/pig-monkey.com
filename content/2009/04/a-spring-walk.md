This past weekend I took a walk out to the Chuckanuts, visiting the same spot <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/02/19/camp/">Avagdu, HatterOfMaddnesz, and I visited a couple months prior</a>. The ice had disappeared from the lake by now. I opted to pitch my tarp up at the viewpoint above the lake, which had caught my fancy last time around. The sun was out and not a drop of rain fell from the sky for both days, making for a pleasant contrast with the last few trips I've taken. In the evening I could watch the sun set over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3460686193/">the San Juan islands in the west</a>, and the following morning watch the sun rise over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3461499512/">Mt. Baker to the east</a>.

I set my Kifaru Paratarp up in an elevated manner, opting to rig it to trees with paracord rather than using my trekking poles underneath. This makes for a huge amount of living space underneath.

On the way out, I made a detour to Raptor Ridge, another nearby viewpoint that I had been unable to visit on the outing with Avagdu and Hatterz.

After fixing a small breakfast and soaking in the view, I finished the 12-ish mile hike home, munching on the odd Stinging Nettle leaf plucked from the side of the trail and pondering butterflies.
