Last week, my Oakley glasses broke, cracking right down the center of the nose piece. I had had them for only a year and a half, which is not very long for a pair of frames. I would have expected to have had the same set for twice that amount of time. Such an event does not bode well for Oakley or my opinion of the quality of their product.

An attempt at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3882343250/in/set-72157622218239564/">repairing the glasses by taping them back together</a> failed. I needed to buy a new pair of frames. Luckily, I was able to take advantage of a sale and acquired two pairs of frames for the price of one, which makes the otherwise obscenely high price of glasses more reasonable. This also gives me a backup pair in case I bust my primary set again.

(This time around, during the period between breaking the Oakleys and receiving the new pairs, I was able to use an older pair of frames with a weaker prescription that I had saved. I should have also been able to use my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2007/06/10/revision-sawfly/">Revision Sawflys</a> with clear lenses installed, but I have not kept the prescription in the insert up to date. This will be addressed for the future.)

Both the new pairs of frames that I chose had advertisements on either side of the arm. Clearly, that would not do. I grabbed the handy-dandy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3881551983/in/set-72157622218239564/">Sharpie sanitizing tool</a> out of my EDC and, in a few moments, had the problem addressed to my satisfaction.

The sanitation job with the Sharpie is evident when inspecting the frames up close, but, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3882357270/in/set-72157622218239564/">at a distance</a>, from where most people are standing, it is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3882353674/in/set-72157622218239564/">not to be noticed</a>. I've also found that the ink will wear off over time. It will have to be reapplied every few months. The small effort is worth it, though, as it helps to clean the environment for all those around me.
