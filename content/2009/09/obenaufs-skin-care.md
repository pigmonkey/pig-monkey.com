I've been <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/03/31/leather-boot-care/">using Obenauf's products</a> on my boots and other leather products since last spring and have been constantly pleased with the results. Though I've replaced their <a href="https://www.obenaufs.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=25">White Jaguar Leather Cleaner</a> with my standard Dr. Bronner's soap that I use to clean everything else, their <a href="https://www.obenaufs.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=18">oil</a> and <a href="https://www.obenaufs.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=20">leather preservative</a> are great products.

A couple days ago, I read <a href="http://wildfirenews.com/fire/articles/obenauf.html">an article</a> which mentions that some people use Obenauf's leather preservative as a skin care product. I was a bit shocked at first, but it makes perfect sense. All the LP consists of are "three different natural oils... suspended in Beeswax and Propolis." And what makes a standard skin care balm? Beeswax, olive oil, and your minced up dried herbs and/or essential oils of choice. LP is pretty much a balm without the herbs. That may make it inferior to products that include the healing power of herbs, but LP <em>is</em> designed to protect skin -- dead skin that you wear on your feet, but skin none-the-less.

(Arguably, this lack of herbal material in the LP could be a benefit: it means that the product has no strongly identifiable scent (a useful trait in the woods). If one did not care about the scent and wanted to add something extra to the LP, it would be a simple matter to melt it and put a few drops of essential oil in. Though that's fine for skin care, I'm not sure I want my boots smelling like tea tree or lavender oil.)

I decided to experiment. This morning I cleaned out a small tin from a commercial balm and filled it with LP (by heating the LP until it liquefied, then pouring it into the smaller container). Now I have a convenient way of carrying the LP around with me, which should encourage me to try it on a regular basis.

I always carry some sort of skin balm with me, both in my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">urban EDC</a> and in my wilderness gear. Usually, I opt for <a href="http://www.badgerbalm.com/pc-14-2-healing-balm.aspx">Badger Healing Balm</a> or <a href="http://www.burtsbees.com/natural-products/sun-outdoor-treatment/res-q-ointment.html">Burt's Bees Res-Q Ointment</a>. I've made my own herbal balms in the past, but, as with <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2006/02/18/today-we-make-soap/">home-made soap</a>, I have never felt that what I made was in any way superior to store-bought products nor that there was a significant financial savings by making my own stuff. If I decide that I like the LP product, I'll probably end up carrying it in my larger rucksack in lieu of a normal balm. That would give me the ability to treat not only my own skin, but also take care of my boots in the wilderness. More functionality than what I have now, and it seems a good plan.
