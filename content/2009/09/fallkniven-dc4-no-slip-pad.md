The <a href="http://www.fallkniven.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=369&category_id=13&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=1&lang=en">Fallkniven DC4</a> is one of the more popular pocket-sized knife sharpeners, particulary among bushcrafters, due in no small part to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjKd3g9GFG8">patronage by Ray Mears</a>.

The technique that Ray Mears uses to keep his stone from moving around is to create a frame by hammering 4 small nails around the stone into a log. This works, but, over on the <a href="http://forums.equipped.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=153712">Equipped to Survive Forums</a>, I picked up a better idea: simply cut up a bit of non-stick rubber padding.

This padding is sold in rolls and meant to be placed between carpets and hard-wood floors to prevent the carpet from moving around. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCQTT2/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2/182-4915098-3521317?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_r=0RMV9BY39ZPSKAN61H8M&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_i=B000H7RX56">stuff that I use</a> is actually meant to line shelves and drawers. The only different between it and the carpet padding is that the shelf and drawer stuff has smaller squares and a tighter mesh.

I find the padding to be much more convenient that the nails. It's easier to deploy -- you don't have to take the (albeit small amount) of time to hammer in and then remove the nails; the pad works just as well on a rock as it does on a log; and the pad does not get in the way when sharpening, as the nails will sometime do.

For storage and transportation, I simply wrap the pad around the DC4's sheath and secure it with a rubber band.

I still carry the small nails in the bottom of the sheath just in case, but I think the pad is a better way to go.
