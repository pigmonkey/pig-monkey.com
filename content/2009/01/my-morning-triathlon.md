I always run on Saturday morning. When my schedule allows it, I try to get in at least one additional run at some point during the week. The past few months, this didn't happen very often. Since the new year, my schedule now allows me to run on both Tuesday and Thursday mornings, in addition to the usual Saturdays.

This morning was the first run I had taken in close to a month where it wasn't raining (or <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/12/20/i-find-running-more-satisfying-in-the-winter/">snowing</a>). It was so enjoyable that I decided to add something extra: at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1991696592/in/set-72157607433063482/">the park</a> that marks my half-way point, I stopped and did 45 elevated push-ups off one of the benches before continuing on home. When I first started running again, it actually felt a little easier, since my legs and lungs had gotten about a minute break from the running, but soon after I discovered that my abdominal muscles weren't too happy with me.

After running on weekdays, I only have about a 20 minute break to take a shower and break-fast before jumping on my bike and pedaling off to work. My morning commute is all up a hill that gets progressively steeper as one gets higher. Over the winter holidays, my office was moved about another half mile up the hill. Rather than riding my bike all the way up, I've taken to going up only about halfway, then walking up 55 stairs with the bike on my shoulder.
