Last February I began a training ritual in preparation for my anticipated <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/17/departure/">journey to Spain</a>. Every weekend that I could, up to the very time of my departure, I would load up <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/02/24/i-live-here/">my Kifaru ZXR</a> with the heaviest books I owned till it reached something in the range of 70-80 lbs, then head out the door and hike 15-20 miles. In reality, this is far more weight than I usually carry while traveling and I tend not to walk much more than 15 miles a day. But by pushing my body and mind further than where I actually require it to go, the pleasure, serenity, and ease of travel is heightened.

I find that no amount of running, biking, or light-weight day hiking adequately prepares the body for the weight of the ruck and life on The Road. So, this year, I'm continuing the training. Yesterday was day one. I hadn't walked under my heavy rucksack for a couple of months, so I started out with something probably closer to 50 lbs and did a 15 mile trip that lacked much elevation change.

It felt good to dust off the rucksack and move around some. At the end of the day, I could feel the strain in my gluteal muscles. Today I'm only a little bit sore. The exercise works and I'm glad of my starting weight and mileage.

In the coming weeks, I'll increase the weight and mileage until I reach stability. At that point, I'll keep things interesting by using my GPS to clock my speed and see what I can do about cutting down on time.

<blockquote>I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least -- and it is commonly more than that -- sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. You may safely say, A penny for your thoughts, or a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them -- as if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon -- I think that they deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago.
