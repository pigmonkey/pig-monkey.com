Last weekend Avagdu, HatterOfMaddnesz, and I loaded up our packs and went for a jaunt in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckanut_Mountains">Chuckanuts</a>. The hike in was about 6 miles, with an elevation gain of something on the order of 1,600 feet. (In the planning stage, I had told them to expect 7 miles and 500 feet. I suppose next time I should look at the map, rather than relying on memory.)

Avagdu and HatterOfMaddnesz claimed that this was the longest hike that they had done in a while, but they both pulled through. Avagdu used the opportunity to field-test his <a href="http://zombiehunters.org/wiki/index.php/BOB#The_I.27m_Never_Coming_Home_.28INCH.29_Bag">INCH Bag</a>, which was quite heavy. It gave him a hard time. I think he'll be shedding some of the redundancy the next time around. Certainly, we all learned something.

We spent two nights at a lake and took a hike up to a ridge that gave views of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forgottendepths/3292871635/">Mt. Baker to the east</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forgottendepths/3292874419/">the San Juan Islands to the west</a>. (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forgottendepths/3293697296/">I took a nap.</a>) My camera battery died soon after setting up camp the first night, so pictures are sparse.
