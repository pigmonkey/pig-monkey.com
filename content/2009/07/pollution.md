I do not understand why so many outdoor-gear manufacturers insist on making gear in bright, unnatural colors. To me, it is a form of visual pollution. To be enjoying oneself in the wild and suddenly come upon a hiker in a bright red shirt, or a noisy yellow tent, is a rude shock. It seems to me an attempt to visually isolate humans from the non-human environment -- something that we are exceedingly fond of, based on some flawed Abrahamic notion of everything non-human having been created for the entertainment of humans.

Earth-tones should be the order of the day. Here is a photo of my camp, taken from only a couple hundred feet away. It is exposed, out in the open. No attempt was made to camouflage it. Can you spot it? (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695308685/sizes/o/in/set-72157620919897531/">Large version</a>)

With such a simple setup -- a brown tarp and a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695251829/in/set-72157620919897531/">green pack</a> -- I can blend with the environment, not disturbing the other occupants of the area, human or otherwise. 

You and I are part of that world -- <em>the</em> world -- and should not seek to create barriers or erect boundaries between us and it. Do not noisily advertise your presence, disturbing those who may be around you. Embrace the world, sink into it and wrap it around you. It's not such a bad place.
