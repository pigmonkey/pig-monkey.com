When I first heard of <a href="http://www.thestickpic.com/">The StickPic</a>, I <a href="http://twitter.com/pigmonkey/status/2013035600">sent Avagdu a tweet</a> about it, thinking that he might find it useful for the video that he shoots. <a href="http://twitter.com/rodneyjava">Rodney Java</a>, the inventor of the StickPic, saw this and <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/04/01/gear-list/#comment-36346">offered to send me a free one for my trekking poles</a>. I readily accepted, singing the praise of Web 2.0.

It's a <a href="http://www.thestickpic.com/Step%20by%20step%20StickPic%20directions.html">very simple</a> device. The top screws into a camera's standard tripod socket and the bottom slides onto the tapered end of a trekking pole. You can then set the camera's self timer, hold out the pole, and take a self portrait. Or pretend that you're Les Stroud and shoot a little video. Overall, an ingenious little device.

My initial worry about the StickPic was that it would fall off the tip of the pole, taking my camera for a tumble down the side of a mountain. So far, that has not been a problem. You can jam the StickPic on the tip of the poles pretty tightly, and also loop your camera's wrist strap around the pole above the basket for added security.

I usually carry a <a href="http://joby.com/products/gorillapod/original/">Joby Gorillapod</a> with me and keep <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3698885805/">the attachment doohickey</a> for that screwed into my camera's tripod socket. Switching that out for the StickPic takes only a few seconds.

The Gorillapod is overall a more versatile device, but fails to address the problem that StickPic primarily concerns itself with: when you are alone, in an alpine environment, with no conveniently situated tree branches to wrap the Gorillapod around or perfectly sized boulders to set it on top of.

In terms of size and weight, the StickPic wins out. It weight 0.3 oz, compared to the Gorillapod's 1.5 oz.

So far this summer, I've been carrying both. They each address different needs and only weigh a combine total of 1.8 oz. Not much weight for the extra versatility added to your photography arsenal.

<h2>Update:</h2>
There's a new and improved StickPic now available. <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/01/06/the-new-stickpic/">Check out my review</a>.
