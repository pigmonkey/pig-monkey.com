I've changed my jabber account to <strong>pigmonkey@jabber.org</strong>. The old account is no longer active.

The jabber.org server doesn't support transports, so I am no longer reachable through the old ICQ or AIM accounts. All the contacts I actually speak with seem to be on XMPP, so that shouldn't matter.
