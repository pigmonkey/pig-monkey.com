I've moved this domain back to Dreamhost. It's been <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/09/a-move-to-slicehost/">a good run with Slicehost</a>. I still think that they are the superior host (I've already noticed a slowness with Dreamhost compared to Slicehost) and I greatly prefer the freedom and control of a VPS over shared hosting, but Dreamhost is cheaper and I need to cut down expenses. In the future I may move back to Slicehost again.

If anybody finds anything broken due to the move, let me know.
