Here's a neat trick I picked up from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hQM8ahtMcY">Dusty's YouTube video</a>. In the video, he shows how to use a couple of old bicycle inner-tubes to make a semi-waterproof pouch for a BIC lighter. That didn't appeal to me too much: I always carry a BIC in my pocket and his idea added to much bulk for my liking. But, at the end of the video, he cut a smaller piece of inner-tube to make a sort of sheath for the lighter.

I thought that was a great idea. It gives you a nice, rubberized grip for the BIC and provides a simple way of always carrying waterproof tinder.

I've now cut off pieces from a 700x35 bicycle inner-tube and made this modification to all my lighters.
