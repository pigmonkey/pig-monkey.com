Last weekend I decided to finally invest in a digital postal scale for the accurate weighing of gear. Prior to that, all I've had is a small kitchen scale that I use for weighing herbs. It was inaccurate (and not digital, so reading its inaccurate measure was always a trick that invariably introduced further inaccuracies) and weighed only up to 16 oz.

The scale I've replaced it with is an Ultraship #35 shipping scale. In addition to having a digital display, it's also able to weigh in ounces, grams, pounds, and kilograms. It's accurate to 0.1 oz, which is good enough to me. The #35 in the product name signifies that it can weigh up to 35 lbs (they also have #55 and #75 models). The display bit can actually separate from the scale bit, which is a nifty feature when weighing over-sized items. The scale only cost $25 (including shipping). I bought it on eBay from <a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.com/www-OLDWILLKNOTT-com__W0QQ_armrsZ1">OldWillKnottScales</a>.

I received the scale this morning. I've started a database of weights of individual pieces of gear using Google Docs, <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rkWMdPMTMCFFQjvJwrWaB9A">which I've published for anyone to view</a>. I'll add to the document as I weigh more gear.
