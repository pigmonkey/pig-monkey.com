Today I went on a longer bike ride than the previous day. I didn't want to carry the size or the weight of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3863588194/">FAST Pack EDC</a>, so I grabbed the Kifaru E&E. I use the E&E as my alternate EDC bag when I need something smaller.

The items in the E&E are simply transferred over from the EDC items in the FAST Pack, but not every item makes the cut. This is a more minimalist setup. All level 1 and level 3 EDC items remain the same.
