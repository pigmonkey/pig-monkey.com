Here's another great idea that I gleaned from scanning the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/forums/index.html?id=9sTyccSp:216.254.23.78">BackpackingLight Forums</a>: using the plastic container from an old <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/747197">bike tube patch kit</a> as a soap bar container.

Whole soap bars tend to be far too large and heavy for any but the longest of travels. Cutting up a bar of soap to make it smaller is easier enough, but prior to this I had never come across a correctly sized container to package it in.

This container is perfect. It measures in at 3.25" x 1.75" x 0.9", weighs 2.5 oz when full, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3869553772/">holds about 1/3rd of a bar</a> of <a href="http://www.drbronner.com/DBMS/BAR.htm">Dr. Bronner's Bar Soap</a>. I wrap a rubber band around it for added security.
