My favorite food to toss in the dehydrator are bananas. The sugars caramelize as the slices heat up. I'll leave them in for 7-8 hours if I want them to dehydrate fully, so that the final product is like a chip. But my preference is to leave them in for only 6-7 hours, so that they're still a bit chewy, like candy. <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Starburst_%28confectionery%29">Starburst</a> doesn't have anything on these!

On <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/20/a-few-days-in-the-glacier-peak-wilderness/">our recent trip</a>, Kevin mentioned how much he liked the dehydrated strawberries that he recently had. I thought I'd give them a shot.

I cut them up in 1/4" slices, which is the same as I do for bananas, but they turned out too thin after coming out of the dehydrator. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Bells-Complete-Dehydrator-Cookbook/dp/0688130240">Mary Bell's Complete Dehydrator Cookbook</a> claims that strawberries are 90% water, whereas bananas are only 76%. So in retrospect it makes sense that the strawberry slices would shrink down a bit more.

No matter. They're still tasty! But the bananas remain my favorite.
