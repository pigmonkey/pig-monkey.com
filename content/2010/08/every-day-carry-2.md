It's been about a year since <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">the last one</a>, so today I did another dump of what is currently in my pockets and bag. Everything that I am carrying today is representative of what I carry most every day. Much of it is the same as last year.

Some things occasionally change: I frequently switch between the Emerson Mini-Commander and the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/01/rat-izula-neck-knife/">Izula</a> (I probably carry the Izula more frequently than the Emerson). If I need more stuff, I might change the bag to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3863588194/">TAD Gear FAST Pack EDC</a> or the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/29/alternate-edc-bag/">Kifaru E&E</a>.
