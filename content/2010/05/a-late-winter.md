I was up around Lake Twenty Two yesterday, further exploring the area and testing small changes to my gear load out. I was surprised at the amount of snow I encountered. There was a good foot of it around the lake, whereas <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/01/29/lake-twenty-two/">at the end of January there was only a dusting</a>. Winter and Spring seem to have gotten themselves confused.
