I bought one of the newer <a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/wide/klean-kanteen-27oz-wide.html">27oz wide mouth Klean Kanteens</a> back in March. My favorite bottle is still the old 40oz Klean Kanteen that I keep in my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">EDC bag</a>, but I've been wanting something a bit skinnier that could fit in the bottle cage on my bike. I also was looking for an excuse to try out one of the newfangled wide mouth Klean Kanteens. I prefer a wide mouth opening on my bottles, but my 40oz Klean Kanteen (despite being beat on fairly heavily for the past few years) is in too good a shape to justify replacing it with a 40oz wide mouth. A new 27oz wide mouth bottle that would fit on my bike (not to mention in most car cup holders) and so supplement the 40oz bottle was easier to talk myself into!

To go along with the wide mouth bottle, I also purchased a <a href="http://www.humangear.com/capCAP.html">humangear capCAP</a>. This product of questionable capitalization addresses the same problem as Guyot Design's <a href="http://www.guyotdesigns.com/category.php?id_category=5">Splashguard</a>: how to drink from a wide mouth bottle while moving without ending up with half the bottle's contents on your face and the other half up your nose. The capCAP allows the user to take advantage of the wide mouth for filling and cleaning (as well as water filter integration), but also provides a smaller opening for drinking.

The wider cap has indentations on it making it easy to grab and turn. The smaller cap, in addition to the indentations of the larger cap, is made of rubber, which makes for an easy grip while wearing gloves. The rubber has a tendency to pick up small amounts of dirt and sand, but so far I have not found this to be an annoyance.

My habit in unscrewing bottle lids is to hold the body of the bottle in my left hand and unscrew the lid with my right. The problem with doing this with the capCAP is that attempting to unscrew the small lid tends to start to loosen the larger lid as well. All that's needed to rectify this is to hold the larger cap in my left hand rather than the body of the bottle itself. This forces a change of habit, which took me a couple weeks to get used to, but I now grab the larger cap with my left hand while unscrewing the smaller cap without thinking. I haven't had a problem with it since.

When using the capCAP with my wide mouth Klean Kanteen, I find that it does leak slightly. If the bottle lays down on its side for a bit, a couple drops of water will escape from underneath the larger cap. The threads on the bottle's lip must not match up perfectly with those on the capCAP. If the bottle was to be thrown loosely into the body of the pack where it could shift around and potentially get a drop or two on some form of paper, I would opt for the more secure closure of the standard Klean Kanteen lid. But when the bottle is in the cage on my bike or stored upright in a pouch on my pack's waist belt, this small leak is no problem.

The capCAP can of course be used on other wide mouth bottles. I also use it on my <a href="http://www.nalgene-outdoor.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=59">32oz HDPE Nalgene</a> as well as my <a href="http://www.guyotdesigns.com/product.php?id_product=87">32oz Guyot Designs Backpacker</a> and have not noticed any leaking with those bottles. It's a pretty neat product that I think makes a great addition to any wide mouth bottle.

Here are the weights of various lids, measured on my scale:
