Occasionally I get asked what motivates me to run on a regular basis. For me, running is fun. I wouldn't do it if it wasn't. During the run, I take pleasure in partaking in an activity that I believe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o">Homo sapien sapien was designed to do</a>, and after the run my body feels better.

If that's not enough, try this: In his autobiography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0340951834">Mad, Bad &amp; Dangerous to Know</a>, Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranulph_Fiennes">Ranulph Fiennes</a> said that, now in his late sixties, the only way he can manage to keep up a decent level of fitness is to run at least 2 hours every other day. I'll not be physically bested by an old man, even one such as Fiennes!
