This kit is kept in the lid of my rucksack, which also functions as a man-purse for short trips away from camp. It is intended for emergencies only, and so is secondary (or even tertiary) to my normal fire starting equipment: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/06/simple-ferrocerium-rods/">ferro rod(s)</a>, <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/28/rubberized-bic-lighter/">rubberized BIC lighter</a>, <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/02/k-m-match-case/">matches</a>, and a fair amount of cotton balls covered in petroleum jelly. The kit here is to be used only when these other methods of starting fire have for some reason failed.

It is quite simple and is probably nothing unique. Everything is kept together and dry inside of a small <a href="http://www.loksak.com/products/aloksak">aLOKSAK</a> (measuring 5"x4"). It weighs 2.8 oz. The contents are as follows:

That's a whole lot of fires that I can start with just this small kit, and I don't even have to start messing around with natural tinder or making char-cloth yet!

Previously the envelope held a small ferrocerium rod and striker in lieu of the Spark-Lite. I've never been too impressed with the Spark-Lites: the sparks produced are relatively small and weak. They are fine for starting a fire with prepared tinder such as cotton balls or those commercial products included in this kit, but trying to get a natural tinder to take with them can be a bit of a pain. As for the whole one-handed fire starting thing -- well, I have never broken my arm or hand. I <em>have</em> been cold enough to not have the fine motor control needed to reliably operate a Bic lighter or Spark-Lite. So for me, given the choice between a normal ferro rod and a one-handed Spark-Lite, I'd go for the normal rod. It requires a gross movement that I know I can always achieve, even when cold.

I decided to remove the ferro rod and add the Spark-Lite to this kit because I figure that I have enough ferro rods stashed here-and-there (including at least one tethered to my body) that the chances of me losing <em>all</em> of them are very slim. (I would be more likely to lose this kit, which is kept in my pack, not on my body.) I should never have to depend on whatever spark-making tool I keep in the envelope, but by opting to make that tool a Spark-Lite, I do give myself the possibility of one-handed fire making (without depending on lighters or trying to light a match held in my teeth). <a href="http://www.equipped.org/firestrt.htm">Doug Ritter would be proud</a>.
