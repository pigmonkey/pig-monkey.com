<a href="http://www.itstactical.com/">ITS Tactical</a> is a site that, in their words, is dedicated to <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/about/">living better on the tactical side of life</a>. The site only launched in April of 2009, but with its tutorials, gear reviews, and other articles, has already established itself as mainstay in the community. I first discovered ITS last summer, and it immediately became one of my daily reads.

Last week, Bryan, the editor-in-chief, contacted me and said that he was interested in featuring my work with the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/06/22/diy-tyvek-stuff-sack/">DIY Tyvek Stuff Sacks</a> on ITS. I had been meaning to rewrite that article, anyways, in order to demonstrate my new method for constructing the sacks. So I jumped at the opportunity to be a guest writer for ITS. You can see <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/gear/diy-tyvek-stuff-sacks/">my article on ITS right here</a>, and all the photos are of course <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157620193065231/">available on Flickr</a>.

If you're coming here from ITS, welcome! You might be interested in <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/gear/">gear stuff</a>, or more specifically <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/edc/">EDC stuff</a>. Or maybe <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/wilderness/">wilderness stuff</a>. Who knows. There sure is <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/what/#archives">a lot of stuff</a>.
