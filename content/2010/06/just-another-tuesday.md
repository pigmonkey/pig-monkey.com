After taking the photos I wanted for today's <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/15/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-dry-sacks/">stuff sack review</a>, I spent the rest of the afternoon watching tadpoles, walking along railroad tracks, and looking at clouds.

<blockquote>"Then one day it dawned on me that... you can't rely on the accomplishment of goals or journeys -- however great or small -- for your happiness, because the completion of a goal is only a temporary gratification. If you want to be happy then you must enjoy it all, at whatever point your are at, from the beginning to the end, because happiness it the acceptance of the journey as it is now, not the promise of the other shore."
