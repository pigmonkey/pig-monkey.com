I love my <a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/7">Sea To Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sacks</a>. They're made out of a thin and slippery silnylon Cordura, which makes them tough, light, and easy to slide in and out of a pack. The Hypalon roll top closure means no water can get in or out. All the seams are double stitched and taped on the inside. In all, the Ultra-Sil sacks are some of the lightest weight dry bags out there that still maintain a good level of durability. I've had an 8 liter and 2 liter model for about three years. Last Fall, I picked up a 13 liter model.

<h2>8L Ultra-Sil</h2>

The 8 liter model is my most used bag. I use it primarily to carry clothing. For me, it's the perfect size for 3 season use. During the winter, when I'm carrying more puffy clothing, I sometimes have to supplement it with a secondary sack. I've had the whole thing accidentally submerged multiple times and never came out with wet contents.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4704465701/" title="8L Ultra-Sil by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1305/4704465701_4651fbb081.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="8L Ultra-Sil" /></a>

The 8 liter sack also functions as my pillow at night. This is a bit tough on the sack, since as a pillow it normally sits directly on the ground above my sleeping pad and so gets rubbed around on the dirt and rocks. In the 3 years that I've used it as a pillow, I've only ever had one failure -- and that one just after <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/11/a-week-in-the-wenaha-tucannon-wilderness/">this last trip</a>. There was a small abrasion near the seam in the middle of the bag that I noticed dripping water when I was cleaning the bag. A dab of <a href="http://www.mcnett.com/SilNet-Silicone-Seam-Sealer-P143.aspx">Mcnet Silnet</a> on the inside and the outside of the bag sealed that right up and the sack is once again waterproof.

<h2>2L Ultra-Sil</h2>

The smaller 2 liter bag has seen a variety of duties. It's held a first aid kit, notes, and small clothing items like gloves and a hat. For the past 6 months it has functioned as my camera case. You may remember that <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">back when I did an EDC post</a> I mentioned in the photo notes for my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3863588194/">level 2 items</a> that I wrapped my camera in a bandanna for padding and then put that in a waterproof Aloksak. The problem with that setup is that Aloksaks aren't incredibly durable, nor are they cheap. I can't afford to replace them every time they fail. So I moved to putting the bandanna-wrapped camera in the 2 liter Ultra-Sil sack. It's just as waterproof (if not more so), but also more durable. The other benefit to using the Ultra-Sil is that I have plenty of room left over in the sack to dump in my cell phone when traveling in the wilderness.

<h2>13L Ultra-Sil</h2>

The 13 liter Ultra-Sil I bought last Fall to hold my sleeping bag. Prior to this I used a <a href="http://kifaru.net/stuffsack.html">Kifaru Compression Stuff Sack</a>. The Kifaru sacks are great at compressing bulky items down. Patrick <a href="http://kifaru.net/reg_stufhist.htm">developed</a> them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705120998/in/set-72157624160363947/">compress around the circumference of the item</a>, rather than length wise, so that they actually fit in the bottom of a pack (strangely enough, a novel idea). They're made of a lightweight and waterproof material, but only close with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705117514/in/set-72157624160363947/">a drawstring closure</a>. This means that water can potentially creep inside. I've used one of these sacks in some capacity since 2007 and never once had an item get wet, but it's always a risk. The other issue for me is that I rarely ever max out the capacity of my pack. I can afford the space for bulky items and don't <em>need</em> to compress them. So I decided to start using the Ultra-Sil sack for my sleeping bag. They don't compress, but they guarantee that my sleeping bag will always stay dry and, due to the lack of compression straps, the Ultra-Sils are lighter than the Kifaru sacks. (The small Kifaru compression sack -- which I use for both my 20F bag and my 40F bag -- weighs 68 grams, or 2.4 oz.) The 13 liter is a good size for my 20F bag. The 8 liter is a better size for my 40F bag, but because I only have one 8 liter sack and it's always used for clothing, I usually end up using the 13 liter sack when carrying my 40F bag as well.

The only thing that I don't like about the Ultra-Sil sacks is lack of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705123068/in/set-72157624160363947/">a grab handle on the bottom</a>. When I stuff my sleeping bag into the sack and purge out the air, it gets packed in there pretty well. To remove it I have to hold the bottom of the sack. Since there's no grab loop, that means that I have to pinch the bottom, which also means pinching the sleeping bag itself. It's not a big deal, but a grab loop on the bottom would make removing the sleeping bag ever-so-slightly easier.

If you're looking to keep gear dry without a large penalty in weight, I would strongly recommend picking up two or three of the Ultra-Sil Dry Sacks.
