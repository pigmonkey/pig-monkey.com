I've been doing a few training hikes lately: loading the old rucksack up with 55-60lb, walking through forests and scrambling up peaks. The winter has been unusually warm, which has allowed me to access places that are usually off-limits this time of year without technical equipment. Yesterday I ventured out to Lake Serene, at the base of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Index">Mt. Index</a> (just the other side of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4312119594/">Skykomish valley</a> from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953854733">Baring Mountain</a>).

At a little over 7 miles (round trip) and only 2,000 feet elevation gain, this was a relaxing walk; a bit of an award to myself for completing the other, more difficult climbs.

The trail was snow free till about a mile or so before the lake. After that, there was a dusting of crusty snow -- no more than an inch -- and quite a bit of ice.

I ate lunch at the frozen lake, watched an avalanche on Index's north peak, and raced the sun back home.
