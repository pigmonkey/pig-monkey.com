This past summer, I <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/07/07/the-stickpic/">reviewed</a> the <a href="http://thestickpic.com/">StickPic</a>, which Rodney Java, the inventor, was kind enough to send me. Last week Rodney sent me one of his new and slightly improved StickPic models.

The first change is in how the markings are applied to the StickPic. According to Rodney,
<blockquote>We now have a new machine shop producing the StickPic who cnc engraves our name and model numbers. In the past, we used a metal die stamp and stamped every StickPic by hand. This produced inconsistent results.</blockquote>

The difference is noticeable. In the old model, pictured on the left, you can see how the thickness of the lettering varies. The new engraving looks more professional, but this is only a cosmetic difference, and not one that I think really matters.

The next immediately noticeable difference is the nut:
<blockquote>A new 8 star jam nut is now used which allows the user, while wearing gloves, to easily attach the StickPic to the camera.</blockquote>

This is certainly a more significant change than the engraving. I find that it makes the StickPic easier to both attach and deattach even when not wearing gloves. The new nut is not only easier to grab, but it also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4252450963/">spins more freely</a> than <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4252469419/">the old</a>.

The third and final change is the hole itself:
<blockquote>The through hole on the new model is also slightly tapered to ensure it stays on the trekking pole more securely; it wedges in a little better.</blockquote>

</ul>

You can see in the photos that the new Stickpic slides much further down the tip of the pole than does the old one. I'm not sure how much this contributes to security: I installed both StickPics on either one of my poles and shook them around violently. Neither came off. Granted, I didn't have the extra weight of a camera attached to either StickPic. But I've also never had my camera fall off the pole during normal use with the old StickPic.

The weight of the new StickPic has been slightly increased -- probably due to the winged nut. My scale puts the old model at 8 grams and the new one at 10 grams. (Though my scale is only accurate down to 1 gram, so it isn't the best for measuring such lightweight items.) Personally, I think the new nut is worth an additional 2 grams!

I think that all three changes to the StickPic are marked improvements, with the new nut being the most significant of the lot. I do not think that any of the changes are enough to warrant purchasing the new model if you are happy with the old one, but they will improve the device for new users.

<h2>Note:</h2>
In the above photos, the new StickPic is installed on a trekking pole without a basket. It is not necessary to remove the pole's basket to use the StickPic. I simply lost the basket for that pole a while back and never replaced it. Even though it slides much further down the tip of the pole than does the old model, the new StickPic will fit on the other pole without interfering with the basket.
