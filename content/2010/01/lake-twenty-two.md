I tossed another 10lb weight in my pack and headed out to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pilchuck">Mount Pilchuck</a> area. I ended up walking out to (the creatively named) Lake Twenty Two at the base of Pilchuck and bushwhacked around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Natural_Area">research natural area</a> a bit.

There was very little snow. It's going to be a dry summer.
