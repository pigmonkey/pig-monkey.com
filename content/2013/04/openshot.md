In the past I've used [OpenShot](http://www.openshot.org/), but I was hit with some bugs that made me search for alternatives. Now I use [Kdenlive](http://www.kdenlive.org/), which I've found to be very capable. OpenShot currently has a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/421164014/openshot-video-editor-for-windows-mac-and-linux) on to fund further development. Even though I'm no longer a user, I happily backed the project.
