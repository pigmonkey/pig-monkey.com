Slug: crash

I crashed my bike this morning. I landed on my chest and skidded a few feet on the concrete. Luckily I was wearing my [Hill People Gear Snubby Kit Bag](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/11/19/i-reviewed-hill-people-gear-kit-bag-its-tactical/). The front of the Kit Bag was torn. It saved my chest (and my nice merino shirt) from the same fate. Thanks [HPG](http://hillpeoplegear.com/)!

The [Defeet Wool Duragloves](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/12/30/defeet-wool-duragloves/) also handed themselves admirably. The right-hand glove is fine. The left-hand glove has a hole in the palm. I expect this low amount of damage is due to the 40% Cordura composition. I would not expect 100% wool gloves to hold up as well.
