[Mako](http://mako.cc/) has published a [short essay](http://mako.cc/writing/hill-freedom_for_users.html) in which he argues in favor of a conceptual shift, referring to "free users" rather than "free software". It draws attention to the larger societal impact of proprietary software, and points out that software that is [free-as-in-freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre) can still create dependent and vulnerable users when used as a 3rd party service in the cloud.
