As with the [Kit Bag](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/11/19/i-reviewed-hill-people-gear-kit-bag-its-tactical/), [my opinion](http://www.itstactical.com/gearcom/packs/hill-people-gear-tarahumara/) of the [Hill People Gear Tarahumara](http://www.hillpeoplegear.com/Products/InDetail/TarahumaraPack/tabid/927/Default.aspx) is high. It stands strong on its own, and has proved a versatile addition to a pack system.
