I somehow managed to loose the pivot screw from my [Emerson Mini-Commander](http://www.emersonknives.com/ekMini_Commander_BTS.php). Last week I ordered a [replacement](http://www.emersonknives.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=EK&Screen=PROD&Category_Code=SpareParts&Product_Code=PivotScrewBlk), which arrived today. Rather than just installing the new screw, I decided to [strip](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/8395903515/in/photostream) the entire knife to [clean and lubricate](http://pcknives.com/cleaningbody.htm) it.

I had never done this before. The knife was purchased in 2006 and has seen some (ab)use. I was surprised at how clean it was in there. But for a little wear around the pivot point the liners could have been new. I wiped everything down with a towel and some rubbing alcohol, dropped a little [ProLink](http://bikes.progoldmfr.com/products/?product=prolink) on the washers, and screwed everything back together.

It's good to go for another 7 years.
