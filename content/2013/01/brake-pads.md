The [salmon compound](http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/brakeshoes.html#salmon) of the [Scott-Mathauser](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6631433603/in/set-72157628707079179) shoes is excellent, but I think the [design](http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/brakeshoes.html#koolstop) of the [Kool Stop](http://www.koolstop.com/) pads will be superior in inclement conditions. They offer dual compound pads that include both the salmon compound and a softer black compound to reduce squealing. I went with [Mountain Pads](http://www.koolstop.com/english/mountain_pad.html) in the rear and [Dura Road Pads](http://www.koolstop.com/english/road_pad.html) up front.
