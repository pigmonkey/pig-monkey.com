Cass Gilbert has been touring regularly for more than a decade. He [shares his writing and photography on his blog](http://whileoutriding.com/). This winter he is [taking a break in New Mexico](http://whileoutriding.com/2012/11/23/changes-wintering-in-santa-fe-new-mexico/), but, if you're new to his blog, the archives contain much of note. Just recently he posted [a gear list](http://whileoutriding.com/2012/12/30/not-ultimate-pack-list/) for a short trip.
