I have done a handful of bike tours ranging from [two](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/09/30/mountain-loop-tour/) to [four](http://pig-monkey.com/2013/04/3/spring-tour/) days, but nothing longer. During the winter I had a notion to do a longer ride this June while waiting for the snows to melt out the backcountry. The idea began as a ride to Idaho, then lengthened to include Montana, and then in practice reverted to the original Idaho idea.

I left on Monday, June 17th and took the first day getting up to [Marblemount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marblemount,_Washington). From there I picked up the Adventure Cycling Association's [Northern Tier](http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/northern-tier/). I followed that route to [Sandpoint, Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpoint,_Idaho), with a detour through [Grand Forks, BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Forks,_British_Columbia) to avoid [Sherman Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Pass_(Washington)). I had intended to use the [Ride Idaho route](http://www.rideidaho.org/route.asp) to head to [Thompson Falls, Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Falls,_Montana) and then loop back through Idaho, but I was concerned about running out of time. Instead, from Sandpoint I took back roads and a highway down to [Spokane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington). There I picked up [US 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_2), which took me back home via [Stevens Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_Pass). The route looked roughly [like this](https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Everett,+WA&daddr=Marblemount,+WA+to:Mazama,+Okanogan,+WA+to:Omak,+WA+to:Tonasket,+WA+to:Grand+Forks,+BC,+Canada+to:Colville,+WA+to:Newport,+WA+to:Sandpoint,+ID+to:Spokane,+WA+to:Wilbur,+WA+to:Wenatchee,+WA+to:Leavenworth,+WA+to:Everett,+WA&hl=en&sll=47.886881,-118.696289&sspn=10.301174,26.784668&geocode=FekZ3AIdIVi3-ClbL_UEZACQVDGQR7Jx8kkkBw%3BFQN55AIdm9PC-CnrxcEpxtqEVDFLBma8q---WQ%3BFdd05QId8MfS-ClBPp67f1ODVDF2iGvoI7nzcw%3BFWmx4gIdgSfg-ClJUP9Iq-mcVDGuzyhrIKIUng%3BFYEu5wIdcH_h-CnBlVcxWS-dVDF9wrhqID6Aww%3BFc8j7AIdravw-CkDsMz-t61iUzFUszZ6SfR9WA%3BFeW85AIdZvn4-ClRjHvdiodiUzFonYIPEdjlbw%3BFawp3wIdxg8G-SlTCHqhiiNiUzHJwRcvwEyygg%3BFW6k4AId4IkN-SlBRf8tM9FjUzF7cenP6zRUqw%3BFRw31wIdgTgA-Snl57swXBieVDGx2YQL1sn83Q%3BFau92AIdabLs-ClzjLHbYy-cVDGpURnk891zDA%3BFeSf0wIdszXU-ClDTwXdQ8ybVDGQ0TNGAmNudA%3BFclC1gIdHNrO-CmN-fikkk2aVDF-778K-5VPoQ%3BFekZ3AIdIVi3-ClbL_UEZACQVDGQR7Jx8kkkBw&dirflg=b&mra=ls&t=m&z=8&lci=bike).

Along the way I camped where I could, stayed at [Warm Showers](http://www.warmshowers.org/) when available, and even did a couple motels. I packed my [Seek Outside Lil' Bug Out Shelter](http://seekoutside.com/products/ultralight-tipis/little-bug-out-shelter/) to provide a bit more luxury than my normal tarp.

Luggage-wise I used the same setup that I have developed on my shorter trips: a combination of bikepacking gear from [Revelate Designs](https://www.revelatedesigns.com/) and [Cleaveland Mountaineering](http://cleavelandmountaineering.blogspot.com/), with small custom panniers from [Velo Transit](http://www.velotransit.com/). This kept me fast and light, without the sacrifice in functionality that I think a strict bikepacking setup necessitates. I ran into other tourists along the Northern Tier, most of whom had heavier setups that they regretted when climbing mountains.

I had no mechanical failures on the trip. Not even a flat. I'm still running the same pair of [Schwalbe Marathon Supremes](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/12/9/evaluating-marathon-supremes/) that I purchased last December. I don't know how many miles I have on them now, but it is somewhere north of 4,000. They have yet to have a flat and the tread, while worn, is still going strong.
