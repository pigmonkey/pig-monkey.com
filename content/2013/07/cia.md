In [the book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594204802/) Mazzetti tracks the CIA's re-entry after 9/11 into the business of killing people, and the resulting decline in their ability to perform intelligence work. It is a good companion to Eric Schmitt's [Counterstrike](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0085RZMC6/).
