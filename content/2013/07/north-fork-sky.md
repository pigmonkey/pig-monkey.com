I refer to this area as [a confluence of Wilderness](/2011/09/12/confluence-wilderness/). The [Wild Sky Wilderness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Sky_Wilderness), [Henry M. Jackson Wilderness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_M._Jackson_Wilderness), and [Glacier Peak Wilderness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Peak_Wilderness) all meet here. This trip was spent [on and around Cady Ridge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157634830835595), field testing the [Hill People Gear Ute](http://www.hillpeoplegear.com/Products/InDetail/UtePack/tabid/926/Default.aspx).
