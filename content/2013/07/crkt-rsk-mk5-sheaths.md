The [CRKT RSK Mk5](http://www.crkt.com/Ritter-RSK-Mk5) is a nice knife cursed by a terrible sheath.

I've been EDCing the knife since my [Nemesis Hellion](http://www.nemesis-knives.com/fixed.htm) was lost last November. Unfortunately, the "glass filled nylon" sheath that the RSK Mk5 ships with is a poor design. The grommet in the tip is too small to accept a piece of paracord. This was done to keep the overall size of the sheathed knife small enough to fit inside an Altoids tin. I have never understood the obsession with the Altoids tin survival kit. I prefer to carry a knife about this size around my neck.

Some time ago I purchased a new sheath for my [RAT Izula](http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/1/rat-izula-neck-knife/) from a fellow on eBay who goes by [lemonwoodgallery](http://myworld.ebay.com/lemonwoodgallery/). I was pleased with that purchase, so as soon as I bought the RSK Mk5 I shipped it to him to make me a custom kydex sheath. It's nothing fancy -- just your standard taco style sheath with two grommets at the top for a piece of paracord and one on the side for retention. This is the same design as the sheath for the Nemesis Hellion, which served me well for 6 years. The new sheath has held the RSK Mk5 around my neck for about 8 months now. It's a much appreciated upgrade.
