Magnouloux spent 5 years cycling around the world. He crossed paths with Richard and Nicholas Crane in Lhasa, and [this book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0946609705) has some echoes of their [Journey to the Centre of the Earth](/2012/09/currently-reading-journey-centre-earth-richard-and-nicholas-crane/).

Thanks to [Joe Cruz](https://joecruz.wordpress.com/) for the [recommendation](https://joecruz.wordpress.com/2010/02/25/travels-with-rosinante/).
