At [Wood Trekker](http://woodtrekker.blogspot.com/) Ross introduces his concept of [the modern woodsman](http://woodtrekker.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-modern-woodsman-concepts-for.html).

> ... [T]he modern woodsman is a person who is able to undertake long term trips, deep into the wilderness, only with supplies one could carry and what could be gathered from the surrounding environment... He uses technology, skills and equipment based on efficiency and practicality. He applies modern hunting techniques, modern understanding of nutrition, and modern climbing, mountaineering, and packrafting techniques. His equipment includes tools that are best suited for the task without consideration for nostalgia and sentimentality.
