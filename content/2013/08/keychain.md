Below the [Maxpedition Keyper](/2013/04/keyper/) I connect a quick-release fob. This adds enough length to the setup that the keys can be silenced in my pocket, but still securely attached to my belt via the Keyper. The side-release buckle provides easy, one-handed access. The fob attaches to the Keyper via a normal split ring.

For most of the 8 years that I've used the fob, I've attached the keys to it via another split ring. I tried a [cable ring from CountyComm](http://www.countycomm.com/ring.html) for some time, but it was too large and the closure unscrewed itself frequently. Later, when the [FREEKey](http://freekeyusa.com/) came out, I gave it a shot. It worked well enough but I found that it offered no practical advantage over a normal split ring. Finally, last March I learned about the [Flex O Loc Key Ring](https://luckyline.com/products/flex-o-loc/) from [Brian Green](http://briangreen.net/2013/03/the-amazing-flex-o-loc-key-ring.html). I bought a pack of them and have been using one on my keychain ever since. I find that they're perfect: the right size, easy to open, and secure when closed.

On the keychain itself I carry three keys: an apartment key, a work key and a bike lock key. Next to the keys is a [Kingston DataTraveler SE9](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006W8U2WU) (16GB). I find that the DataTravelers are a good combination of performance, durability and price. I consider this my "dirty" stick: it holds no personal information and is formatted with FAT32. I'll stick it in pretty much anything. It used to hold [Libert&eacute; Linux](http://dee.su/liberte), but unfortunately that project seems largely abandoned now. Next to the USB stick is a [Photon Freedom Micro](http://www.photonlight.com/led-flashlights/photon-freedom-micro-led-keychain-flashlight/) LED light with a green beam. I've lost count of how many years I've had this. It doesn't produce a significant beam, but it frequently comes in handy. I like to know that I always have a light source attached to me. Next on the ring is the pit for my [Pitlocks](http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/pitlock.asp). This is a specially keyed nut that is needed to remove the Pitlock skewers on my bike. It increases the difficulty of stealing a wheel. The final item is a [SERE V Cutter](http://www.oscardelta.co.uk/v_cutter.html). I consider this more of a toy than a tool. It does [cut cord very well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfOY5bM9QT8), but so does a knife. I wouldn't buy it again, but as long as I have it I figure I might as well use it, and it is small and light enough that I can put it on my keychain and forget that it's there.
