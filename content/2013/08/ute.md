It will come as no suprise after my [Tarahumara](/2013/01/i-reviewed-hill-people-gear-tarahumara-its-tactical/) and [Kit Bag](/2012/11/i-reviewed-hill-people-gear-kit-bag-its-tactical/) reviews that [my review of the Ute](http://www.itstactical.com/gearcom/packs/hill-people-gear-ute-pack-a-modular-backcountry-platform/) is positive.
