Verizon goofed when installing my new circuit at the CO so I haven't had internet at home since Friday. I'm still checking my email at work everyday, though.<br />
Covad (they provide SpeakEasy with bandwidth) is going down to slap Verizon in to shape, so hopefully I'll have internet by Friday.<br />
<br />
As many, many people have noticed (my email is flooded every morning), the proxy is down. Dreamhost took it down because of "excessive resource consumption". Here's a copy of the email:<br />
<blockquote>Hello,<br />
<br />
As you may have noticed, I've removed the execute bit on nph-proxy.cgi.<br />
This type of program is not generally allowed on our servers,<br />
particularly when it results in excessive resource consumption.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

I'm not going to fight them on this because it puts them in an awkward position: in one hand they have free speech and in the other a possible security hole and "excessive resource consumption".<br />
I am working on getting it up at another location (if anybody wants to offer me space at <span class="removed_link">havenco</span>, feel free!), but that's taking a while seeing as how I have no internet. In the meantime, use Garnet's at http://proxy.ccrepair.net.
