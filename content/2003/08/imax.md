I just got back from the Matrix Reloaded: The IMAX Experience. That was fucking <i>awesome</i>. Not only was the movie unspeakably sexy on the eight story high wrap-around screen and the 12,000 watts of digital sound but there were <b>no previews/commercials</b> (they played the soundtrack from the first Matrix instead) and we had chearleaders entertain us before we were seated (no joke, I think they were on some sort of field trip or something). Anyway, go find an <a href="http://www.imax.com/" >IMAX</a> near you and see the movie! There are three in Seattle, but it's only playing at the Boeing theatre at the Pacific Science Center. It's well worth the $9.50!<br />
Oh, and they're now playing the <span class="removed_link">new Revolutions trailer</span> at the end. I would have liked to see the old one...
