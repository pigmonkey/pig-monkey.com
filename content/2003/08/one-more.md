Three posts in one day!<br />
Anyway, I fucked up the blog index by accident and had to start over with a fresh one. I've tried to recreate the old index as best I can but if you notice any discrepancies (I don't have a copy of the old one handy...) or just have any comments in general regarding the blog layout/style sheet, post it as a comment.<br />
Also, you'll now notice that there are archives in the middle iframe at the bottom of the page! Yes sir, 11 months of Pig Monkey-goodness. But wait, there's more! You'll also notice a little 'XML' button that links to the RSS feed of this very blog. Yup, put my blog in your Mozilla sidebar, Ximian Evolution, or any other newsreader.
