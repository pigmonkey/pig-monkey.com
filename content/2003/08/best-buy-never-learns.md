I went to Best Buy today and guess what? Yes, another employee left himself logged in on one of their terminals. This time it was the one in the CD section. Will they never learn? I didn't touch it because I was in too deep a shock from seeing that they had 5 or 6 rows of of "Rock and R&B" but only gave 1/4 of a row to dance. *Sigh*<br />

Oh, and that new computer I talked about yesterday turned out to be quite a catch: 1.3ghz Athlon, 256MB RAM, GeForce2 MX. I still don't know what I'm going to do with it yet. I'm thinking Shorewall.
