Kill Bill: Volume 1 is awesome. It may be a <i>tad</i> on the bloody side for some but that just adds to the whole comic book effect. It's great how they stole Bruce Lee's jumpsuit from Game of Death.<br />
My only criticism is that Uma should be a little bit more cautious when playing with swords. She chops off body parts left and right. Can't she just stab them a few times and not take off their limbs and/or scalp?<br />

In other news, we've had about two weeks of clouds and rain now. Take that, evil ball of fire in the sky! It finally feels like Seattle again.
