I've just updated from <a href="http://cafelog.com/" >b2/cafelog</a> to the brand new, and very shiny, <a href="http://wordpress.org/" >wordpress</a>! 
From the website:
<blockquote>WordPress was born out of a desire for an elegant, well-architectured personal publishing system built on PHP and MySQL and licensed under the GPL. It is the official successor of b2/cafelog, as b2 development has stopped. We hope by focusing on web standards and user experience we can create a tool different from anything else out there.</blockquote>

It only took me about 5 minutes to get it running (transferring everything over from b2 was extremely simple) but there's still a bunch of little tweaks I want to make. And, of course, I need to update the template.

If you are considering updating from b2 to WordPress, the only piece of advice I can give is to change <i>$table_prefix </i> in wp-config.php to <i>b2</i>. It eases the pain while WordPress tries to upgrade your database.
