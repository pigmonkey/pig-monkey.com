Let's see if I can find something to post about...

<a href="http://ncdesign.net/" >Nick</a> finally released v7 (or v 0.7, I can't tell). It only took 6-7 months.

<a href="http://iceadvanced.net/" >Ice</a> mentioned something about a possible LAN party this Friday. We have Monday off, too. We have Monday off, too.

Uhhh...errr...yeah. Not much is happening. I want to make some more minor updates to the site this weekend, including fixing the blog for IE.
Which reminds me, the phorums might be down for a bit Saturday, Sunday, or even Monday. It all depends when/if I get unlazy.

You know, everybody should go spam-- I mean post <a href="http://forums.aelon.net/" >here</a>. They need more traffic.

There's a cool new <a href="http://oldskoolphreak.com/video/cocot.avi" >video</a> up on <a href="http://oldskoolphreak.com/" >Old Skool Phreak</a>.

According to the Mandrake Store, <span class="removed_link">all 9.2 pre-orders will be shipped by the fourth week of October</span>. This just happens to be the fourth week so it should be out soon.
