I upgraded my Netgear RP614 router firmware today. It adds new features such as remote management and UPnP which, remarkably (and thankfully), are turned off by default! Although I still think LinkSys (now Cisco) is a better brand and I was happier with that router, points go to Netgear for somewhat secure defaults. I say somewhat because the default username and password is admin; password (although the default for LinkSys is no username and 'admin' for the password...).
