I decided I'd try the "unofficial" version of Xine (unofficial because it comes with DeCSS) today. While I was at it, I went ahead and got a few other packages with it (real codecs, MPEG4, DivX and Windows Media Player etc). After uninstalling the version that comes with Mandrake 9.1, I had my new Xine back-up and running in less than 5 minutes. Now I can watch any kind of movie in the wonderful GUI that is Xine, including my legally purchased but CSS encrypted DVDs. So far, I've watched the Half-Life2 video, Doom3 video, The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Matrix.<br />
I'll post a tut. on getting everything to work in the phorums later.<br />

Oh, and I went a little trigger-happy on the screenshot button during the Matrix. <span class="removed_link">Here you go</span>.
