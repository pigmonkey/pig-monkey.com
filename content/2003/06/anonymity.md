Slug: anonymity

I've setup <a href="http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/index.php" >IIP</a>, the Invisble IRC Project. Just as the name suggests, it's anonymous IRC. It doesn't work as a bouncer and connect you to normal IRC servers such as dalnet or 2600net, but rather functions as it's own irc server. <a href="http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/aboutMain.php" >Here's a better description</a>. You can find me hanging out in #anonymous and #freenet.<br />
<br />
Speaking of <a href="http://freenetproject.org/" >Freenet</a>, I hadn't really messed with it since my last <span class="removed_link">experiment in March</span> but just yesterday I got it back up and running. After leaving my node up for 24 hours and messing with the config a bit, it seems to operate quite nicely. I recommend anybody (with a broadband connection) to check it out. You can find many interesting files in it.<br />
<br />
Has anybody heard of <a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/index_en.html" >JAP</a>? I think it stands for Java Anonymity and Privacy. Anyway, it's small java application (meaning that it is extremely portable: nix, windows, and mac versions available) that makes your web surfing anonymous. The way it works is sorta difficult to explain, check out their website. All you have to do is set your browser to proxy through 127.0.0.1:4001. Because it's based in Germany, you don't have to worry about the shifty American government tracing you (well, you do, but laws and such make it harder).<br />
I've only been using it for an hour or so, but so far it appears to work quite nicely. It is without a doubt easier than my previous method (daily visits to stayinvisible.com and pinging each foreign server labeled as 'high anonymity' for the best response times).<br />
<br />
I've also just discovered <span class="removed_link">CryptoMail</span>. Haven't had a chance to check it out yet. Does anybody else have any expierence with them?
