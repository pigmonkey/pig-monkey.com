In celebration of summer vacation, I've redone the design a bit. Pretty much all the sections have been updated with the new style sheet (which has actually been online for a while now) and have had their code cleaned.<br />
My stylesheet is now W3C valid and my code is all valid XHTML Transitional. It's actually valid XHTML Strict, with the exception of the iframes.
