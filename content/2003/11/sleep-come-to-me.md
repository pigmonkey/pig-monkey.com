I really need to work on this 'going to bed at a reasonable time' thing. As I'm typing this, my eyelids are getting heavier and heavier. And no, I can't dope up on caffeine or guarana; then I'd never get to sleep. Ah, sleep...Such a wonderful word...
For all I know this snow is just a figment of my imagination. Yes, I said snow. In Seattle. In November. It's not much, but it's there (mixed in with rain, slush, and hail). I love winter.

I haven't posted in a while so there's a few things to say:
I picked up the Revolutions soundtrack a while ago. Most of the tracks suck, except Juno Reactor's Navras. Described by critics as a "9 minute epic", it's the opera/taiko drums/african vocal thingy that plays at the end of the movie, during Smith and Neo's duel. I love it.

What else is happening? I picked up a 4-port data transfer switch for $20 on Ebay that allows me to plug four computers into one monitor (although I'm only using 2). Yay for me. Now I get to move another one of my computers into my room for a yet undisclosed purpose.

The big news in my life is that last Thursday I switched Wintermute's OS from Mandrake Linux 9.1 to Slackware 9.1. So far I love it. The packaging system is great, everything works, and I've learned a whole bunch more from configing everything via command line (It's not a desktop distro, so none of that fancy GUI crap). I think my only complaint is printing. I configured CUPS, which perfectly suits my needs, but some apps seem to want lpr. I'll have to get that setup this weekend. All things considered, Slackware 9.1 gets the <i>Pig Monkey Sweet Lurv</i> Seal of Approval. I recommend it for intermediate users looking to move away from the GUI world of Mandrake, Redhat/Fedora, and Suse. Although that's not to say anything about the desktop-oriented distros. Speaking of which, has anybody used Mandrake 9.2 yet? Until I hear good things about it, I think I'll recommend SuSE for beginners.
In other news (of the OS-switching type), I formatted my laptop and put Libranet 2.7 Classic on it (which is just Debian with a nice installer).

Right. Well, I'm going to attempt to be in bed in...3 hours. Wish me luck.
