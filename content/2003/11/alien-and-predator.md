I went to go see <span class="removed_link">Alien</span> at the <a href="http://www.seattlecinerama.com/" >Cinerama</a>. I never realized how much those aliens really do drool. They need to learn how to swallow or something.
Anyway, it was pretty good and would have been scary if I hadn't seen the movie so many times already.
They also had a preview for <span class="removed_link">Alien vs. Predator</span>, which looks likes fun for the whole family. My money is on the Predator. I mean, come one, he's like an invisible monkey.
