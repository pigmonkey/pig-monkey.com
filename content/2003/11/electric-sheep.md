<a href="http://electricsheep.org/" >Electric Sheep</a> is a screensaver that, when activated, takes advantage of distributed computing power to create artificial organisms: sheep. The sheep are <a href="http://flam3.com/" >fractal flames</a> that evolve, mate, and die based on specific algorithms and user ratings. I recommend watching the <span class="removed_link">documentary</span>.

If you aren't already harnessing idle cpu time with <a href="http://www.distributed.net">distributed.net</a>, <a href="http://electricsheep.org/">download</a> it and colonize cyberspace.
