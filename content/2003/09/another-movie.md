I've put up another mirror, this time of <span class="removed_link">New York City Hackers</span>. Here's the description from the website:<br />
<blockquote>Hackers; malicious vandals or cyberspace freedom fighters? In the last few years hacking have become synomous with electronic crime in the media and the public mind. The federal agencies strikes down hard on any offender it catches, and all off a sudden what has earlier been considered intellectual games becomes serious business...This documentary looks at the "2600" community in New York City of today, its meetings and conferences, political annotations, and historically explores the roots of the definition 'hacking' amongst the model train enthusiasts at MIT...</blockquote><br />
It's 218MB and in DIVX format. I like it alot. So what are you waiting for? <span class="removed_link">Download it!</span>
