I setup a new email address that forwards to my cell phone: mobile at pig dash monkey dot com<br />
<br />
Most likely I won't reply (until I get to a computer, that is) so don't use it for general conversation but if you need to contact me fast for some reason, go ahead. Keep messages shorts, plain text only (no HTML), and no long signitures.<br />
<br />
And if you have a camera phone, you can send your pics to that address. I've got the Sony Ericsson t68i without the optional camera but I can still view all the pics. Sound too.<br />
<br />
Let's see how long before I get my first spam...
