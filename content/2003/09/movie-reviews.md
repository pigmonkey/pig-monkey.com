<b>Underworld</b>: Don't see it.<br />
<b>The Rundown</b>: Irish people aren't Scottish!<br />
<br />
Underworld really did suck the big one. The only thing that made it bearable was Kate Beckinsale. Oh, and they totally stole the ending (Victor's head getting chopped in half) from Equilibrium. That was just cheap.<br />
The previews, on the other hand, were great. First there was Kill Bill which not only has a great theme song but also has an old ninja man kicking Uma Thurman's ass. And then there was the Alien Director's Cut. Only in theatres this Halloween. That'll be sweet.
