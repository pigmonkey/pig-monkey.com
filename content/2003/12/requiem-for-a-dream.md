I just watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005Q4CS/qid=1072239256//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl74/104-4034134-6415914?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846" >Requiem For A Dream</a>. It's directed by Darren Aronofsky, the same guy who did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/078401213X/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/104-4034134-6415914?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846&st=*" >Pi</a>. It's a <i>very</i> good movie, in the same fucked up way that Pi was. Pretty much it's about four drug addicts and the movie just follows them around as their lives are destroyed by their addictions. So, yeah, go rent it.
I highly recommend the soundtrack, too.
