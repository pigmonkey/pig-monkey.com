I'm a little late in this post but <a href="http://www.kde.org/" >KDE 3.1</a> was released on Tuesday. I have yet to install (I think I'll wait for an rpm) so I can't vouch for it but I hear it has a whole bag of sexy new features.<br />
Judging from the screenshots, it looks a little 'cute-ish' (in a fluffy, XP way). Strange? Yes.<br />
In other desktop news: the latest Gnome 2.2 Release Candidate came out today. I'm not a fan of Gnome, but I'll be downloading 2.2 to test it out, anyway.<br />

If Linux and Windows mated, <span class="removed_link">this</span> would be their baby. I'm serious. Check out the <span class="removed_link">screenshots</span>.
