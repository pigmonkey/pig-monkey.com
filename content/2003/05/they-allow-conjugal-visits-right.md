In case I don't get a chance to update again for a while, I'll be at the Matrix tomorrow at 4:45, then I'll be packing for my trip to the Army Ammunition Plant in Hawthorne, Nevada. I'm planning on taking my H2K2 Threat Risk card and see if they detain me, or at least give me funny looks (should I wear my DeCSS shirt?). I'll also bring along my camera to take pictures of my ticket (so we can see what threat level I officially hold) and maybe some pics of the Plant.<br />

Oh, and here's an annoying thing: all my http queries are proxied through Japan and Italy so when I go to google.com, they redirect me to google.it. Now I can say "I'm feeling lucky" in Italian. Mi sento fortunato.
