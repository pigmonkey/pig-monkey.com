ThinkGeek delivered <a href="http://revolution-os.com" >Revolution-OS</a> today. I've watched the first DVD (which is the actual movie) and I plan on putting in the second one (an additional 70 minutes of interviews) later tonight.<br />
If anybody is interested in seeing it, I'll bring it to the next LAN Party (Jacob's).
