Jessica Han's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transient-Ways-Jessica-Erica-Hahn/dp/1890054038" >Transient Ways</a> concerns itself with stories of travel, trains, and squats. Unlike <a href="http://crimethinc.com/a/otm" >Off the Map</a>, this book's writing is amateur, the stories have no cohesion, and the author presents herself as mildly egotistical. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy it. The tales are entertaining -- enticing in their simplicity. Jessica shows promise as a writer, but is no Kerouac.

Jessica is also featured in the excellent hobo documentary <a href="http://catchingout.com/" >Catching Out</a>.
