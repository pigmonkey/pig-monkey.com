I just purchased my first album from <a href="http://magnatune.com/" >Magnatune</a>: Falling You's <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/fallingyou-human/" >Human</a>. It's a pretty cool idea. You can pay whatever you want. All they ask for is a credit card, name, and email -- no addresses, phone numbers, or any of that. They give me a username and password, and I can <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/fallingyou-human/download" >download the album in whatever format I want</a>. Now I can <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/give" >give the album away to 3 people</a>.
