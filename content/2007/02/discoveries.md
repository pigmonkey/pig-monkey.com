I went walking around the Arboretum today, continuing my exploration of the destruction caused by the earlier wind storms. Some of the felled trees picked up a impressive amount of earth with them. You're able to stick your face right in the tangled mess of roots.

The past couple weeks I've spent a lot of time up there, mostly looking for Cedar. The place is strangely devoid of them. Today, I finally found one -- two, actually -- but they're young, and nestled in a hill that offered protection from the winds, so neither was knocked over for my harvesting.

A little further down from the Cedar, I found someone's wallet (ID, credit cards, cash, and a key). It was a bit of a hard walk, but I was able to get it down to the police station and still make my way to class in time -- the class I wasn't skipping. The police dispatcher said she'd give the wallet's owner a call, which I was impressed with. I thought they'd just hold on to it until he called. If I lost anything up there, I would never expect anyone to find it, and probably wouldn't call the cops.
