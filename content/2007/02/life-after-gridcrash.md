Browsing Amazon today, looking for the usual post-apocalyptic survival books, a name jumped out at me: Aric McBay. Could it be? Yes! Aric, of <a href="http://www.inthewake.org/" >In the Wake</a> has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peak-Oil-Survival-Preparation-Gridcrash/dp/1592281273/sr=1-1/qid=1171580749/ref=sr_1_1/102-8167154-2228144?ie=UTF8&s=books" >published</a>! The <a href="http://www.inthewake.org/blog.html" >In the Wake blog</a> appears to be reactivated, too.

The book can be, and should be, <a href="http://www.inthewake.org/order.html" >ordered through his website</a>.
