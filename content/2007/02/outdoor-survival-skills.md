Larry Dean Olsen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Survival-Skills-Larry-Olsen/dp/1556523238/sr=8-1/qid=1172107868/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9494230-7483806?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Outdoor Survival Skills</a>, first published in 1973, was one of the first books to rekindle interest in primitive living skills. And it is, of course, still a worthy read today. It is the only book I've read on the subject that discusses no modern implements. Not once is more than an acknowledgment offered to, for example, a steel knife. All of the skills described in the book are meant to be performed with absolutely nothing but what is found in Wilderness. It covers more than what Elpel discusses in <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/02/13/participating-in-nature/">Participating in Nature</a>, but doesn't go as in depth. Though the author, in the beginning, shows he has skills as a story teller, the book is written more as a manual. It's use of diagrams and pictures are also lacking. But, Olsen's creations are often more elegant than those in Elpel's book. Perhaps it would be better titled Outdoor Living Skills.

I would recommend reading both, though between the two, study and carry Participating in Nature.
