Eddy Joe Cotton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hobo-Eddy-Joe-Cotton/dp/1400048095/sr=8-1/qid=1170564659/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-4786179-0409769?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Hobo</a> is the fast paced adventure of a young runaway turned train rider. The rapid growth and maturity of the author tricks one into assuming a large lapse of time, when in fact the book spans only a few weeks of his life. I didn't enjoy the whole book, nor did I find it to be one of the better books penned by a Hobo. I think his love for the state of Nevada played a role in this. He focuses on many of the things which disgust me about the state. That said, Cotton's short journey on the road is peppered with many insights into the America of the early 90's and plays host to many an interesting character.
