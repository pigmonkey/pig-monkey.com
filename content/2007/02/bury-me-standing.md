Isabel Fonseca's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bury-Me-Standing-Gypsies-Journey/dp/067973743X/sr=8-1/qid=1172465145/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2357968-5731629?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Bury Me Standing</a> digs past the lore of gypsy culture to find the Rom people as they really are. In her travels of Eastern Europe soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she researches the gypsy plight -- early slavery, Nazi death camps, and modern persecution. The book is depressing, but recommended for the insight into the normally closed world of Roma.
