Spring Break is around the corner once more. It's the last week of March, and I haven't decided what to do yet. I think I have it narrowed down to two choices.

I enjoyed Oregon's coast <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/28/finally-a-report/">last year</a>, perhaps more than the Redwoods -- my actual destination -- themselves. One idea is to train down to Eugene, hitch to the coast, and wander on foot from there. (I remember not liking the town that OR-126 dumps you into, but enjoying the areas north and south of it. I don't know which direction I'd travel in.) The trouble is a shortage of time. I'd only have a few days of wandering before having to make my way back to Eugene to catch a train north.

Another idea is to do a little island hopping on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Islands" >San Juans</a>, by foot and ferry. I'm leaning toward this one. It's closer, so I'd have more time, and the ferries are cheap for walk-ons. I've also already got topo-maps of the area, plus a map showing underwater depth counters, buoys and other features of the water that I'll never need but makes me feel special to have. I would like to re-visit Orcas Island. <a href="http://www.raysguides.com/washington.htm" >Ray</a> lists two free campgrounds there. I've also been meaning to revisit <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/parkpage.asp?selectedpark=Fort+Casey&pageno=1" >Fort Casey</a> for two or three years now.

I was considering doing these trips by bike, instead of foot, but my <a href="http://www.microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/title/1667/" >bike-repair-fu</a> is quite weak. I think it would end up being more of a hindrance than help, especially when I want to leave the roads and trails.
