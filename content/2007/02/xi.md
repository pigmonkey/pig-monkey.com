There's nothing like a redesign to welcome Spring in (and it is Spring -- I've seen Mosquito buzzing around and, just today, berries growing on Oregon Grape.) The inspiration hit me yesterday morning, and I whipped it up in a day. It's a little more Web 2.0-<em>ish</em>, but I haven't completely fallen to the darkside -- no gradients or rounded corners.

A marked improvement from the previous design.

I twiddled my thumbs for a while, trying to think of a way to display everything that used to be in the sidebar, before I decided that it was overrated. So, you'll now find the search box at the bottom of the page and a shiny new <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/what/#archives">Archives</a> page, brought to you by the <span class="removed_link">Clean Archives Plug-in</span>. It's not exactly dial-up friendly, so I'll probably fiddle with it a bit more in the future.

How do you like the "pig-monkey.com..." bit over to the right? That was totally a fluke. It wasn't supposed to end-up there, but I thought it looked good.

As usual, I have no idea what version this is, so it's been assigned the arbitrary number of 11. Let me know if you find any bugs. Unless you're using Internet Explorer. I know the site looks funky in that pile of shit. (And I mean no offense to <a href="http://www.weblife.org/humanure/" >piles of shit</a>. They're productive members of our society.)
