In a break from the <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/11/20/it-seems-to-be-a-trend/">usual</a> <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/10/11/always-have-a-camera-ready/">violence</a>, last night there was a different site out my window: a marching band! It was what seemed to be an impromptu marching band of about 7-8 people -- trombones, bass sax, trumpet, drums, conductor, and the rest of it. They were talented, and amassed quite a following.

I hope they'll be back later tonight.
