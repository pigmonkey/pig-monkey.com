My honey stock is running low, and the farmer's market doesn't start up again till April.

Plus, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6400179.stm" >the bees are running away</a>.

I think it's a sign.

A sort of "so long and thanks for all the fish," but with bees.

(The dolphins chose to stay, due to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003569390_dolphins13m.html" >new employment opportunities</a>.)
