Most weeks, I venture out of our mountain stronghold into the autonomous republic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno%2C_California" >Fresno</a>, in search of groceries. It seems ironic to me that despite Fresno's size and location in the huge agricultural production center of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley" >valley</a>, I'm still eating Washington apples.

Does that still count as local?
