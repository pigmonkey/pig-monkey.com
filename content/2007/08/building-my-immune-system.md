A sample of my tap-water is off to the lab today, to see if The Feds have been poisoning me with copper and lead. I've had enough interaction with the guys at the water treatment plant here to guess that the answer is yes.

A couple weeks ago there was an incident with an RV-er dumping his poopy-water near one of our water intakes. A while before that, one of the sewage pipes was leaking into one of the clean water pipes above it.

Advice: don't drink the water in National Parks.
