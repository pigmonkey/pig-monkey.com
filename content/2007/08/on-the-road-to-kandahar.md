Jason Burke's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Kandahar-Travels-Through-Conflict/dp/0312366221/ref=ed_oe_h/104-7363775-4471150?ie=UTF8&qid=1186521159&sr=1-2" >On the Road to Kandahar</a> despite its title does not deal exclusively with Afghanistan and the former power-seat of the Taliban. It is the author's account of his experience reporting, for the last decade or so, from the Islamic world. Focusing on the rise and nature of militant Islam, Burke puts forth his theory on the dispersed and autonomous nature of the groups, analyzing the cause of their rise and their increasingly lacking support from local communities. Though I've yet to read his first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Al-Qaeda-Casting-Shadow-Jason-Burke/dp/1850433968/ref=sr_1_1/104-7363775-4471150?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186521159&sr=1-1" >Al-Qaeda</a>, this one seems to be in large part a rehashing of the same, but updated, broader in scope, and, after the attacks on the author's home city of London, more personal. I quite enjoyed it. A recommended read for those interested in the region.
