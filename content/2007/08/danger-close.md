Bow hunting season started yesterday in the Forest, so now on my patrols I have to watch out for <a href="http://www.onlinesports.com/images/ssg-uss-16d.jpg" >wackos with bows</a> who've (un)knowingly wandered into the Park. Hunting season also means an influx of bears and deer -- they know the boundaries and that they're save from hunters inside the Park.

I think the squirrels are also aware. On my hike today I was bombarded by falling Sequoia cones, cut down by the squirrels above. They seem to be targeting habitual bipeds of all sorts -- taking no chances.
