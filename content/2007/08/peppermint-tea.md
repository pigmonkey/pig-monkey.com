Peppermint tea is excellent for the digestion. I drink a cup after dinner most every night. It immediately does away with that 'stuffed' feeling in my stomach if I accidentally ate too much. The tea greets me with a pleasant smell every time I open the cupboard and is also great for dealing with stress.
