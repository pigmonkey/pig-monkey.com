On my way out of the autonomous republic of Fresno today, I passed a Fresno Tree Removal Service truck with wood-chipper in tow, which struck of chord of humour with me.

We couldn't have <em>trees</em> in Fresno! That would mean shade and clean air and everything else that Fresno so valiantly stands against.
