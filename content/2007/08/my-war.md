Colby Buzzel's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-War-Killing-Time-Iraq/dp/0425211363/ref=sr_1_1/104-7363775-4471150?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186521577&sr=1-1">My War: Killing Time in Iraq</a> falls into the category of books that I'm not sure what to say about -- it leaves one stunned upon completion. Reminiscent of Jarhead, this book version of the author's <a href="http://cbftw.blogspot.com/" >blog</a> is a hard-hitting depiction of the war. There's no coating or attempts to depict false senses of glory and honor and the rest of the recruiter's material. The poor grammar serves to reinforce the raw vision. The highest praise I can give the book, I suppose, is that I burned through it in 8 hours.
