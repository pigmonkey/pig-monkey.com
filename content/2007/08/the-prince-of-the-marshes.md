<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Marshes-Other-Occupational-Hazards/dp/0151012350" >The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq</a>, Rory Stewart's second book, is a depressing read. Detailing Stewart's time as CPA governor in two of Iraq's southern provinces, it gives a clear view of the mess of politics in the country. Despite intentions, any action taken by any party is turned negative, or at best futile -- demonstrating the failure inherit in a people who do not wish to be governed, being governed by a people who do not wish to govern.
