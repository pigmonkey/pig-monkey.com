I attempted to snap a few photos at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass" >Critical Mass</a> (Halloween edition) last night, but the low light and difficultly of riding my bike at the same time conspired against me. None of them turned out.

So, instead, you'll just have to come out. We meet at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1200+Railroad+Ave,+Bellingham,+WA+98225,+USA&sa=X&oi=map&ct=title" >Depot Market</a> (right across from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1107+Railroad+Ave,+Bellingham,+WA+98225,+USA&sa=X&oi=map&ct=title" >Boundary Bay</a>) at 5:15PM, the last Friday of every month. The mass usually doesn't take off till about 5:30PM and there's no set route, but rides generally last from 1 to 2 hours. Our city's motorists are mostly supportive.
