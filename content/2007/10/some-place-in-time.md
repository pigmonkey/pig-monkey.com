I went for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157607433063482/">a walk along the bay</a> today. While I was climbing around in a tree house, an old man with a pipe and accordion walk underneath and asked if I slept up there. A comment on my appearance, perhaps? I don't know, but I took it as a compliment -- certainly better than the "did you use to be in the army?" comment I received last month.

(I'm holding out for the day when outdoor gear makers see the light and PALS webbing becomes common on civilian gear.)
