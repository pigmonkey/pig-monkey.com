<em>I wrote this last month. It still holds.</em>

I'm back at my desk job. Classes have begun. Summer -- as if a dream -- has passed by and, though I've only been sedentary for a matter of days and I've enjoyed my return to this wonder-full city, my feet have begun to itch. Once more I feel the need to wander, to cast off and let the Road take me where it will.
