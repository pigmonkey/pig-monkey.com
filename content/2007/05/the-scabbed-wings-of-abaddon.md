Like <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2005/08/04/the-bloodstained-rabbit/">The Bloodstained Rabbit</a> the book is a work in occult-horror, but this one is much more mature, both in its concepts and execution. 

The editing could still use work -- misused punctuation and similar looking but incorrect words are all to be found, though, unlike Bloodstained, not often enough to detract from the overall work.

A recommended read for fans of Sean, the occult, and/or horror.
