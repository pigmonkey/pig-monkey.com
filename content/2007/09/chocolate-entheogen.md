<blockquote>Chocolate 'aids fatigue syndrome'

A daily dose of dark chocolate may help reduce the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, say UK researchers.

Patients in a pilot study found they had less fatigue when eating dark chocolate with a high cocoa content than with white chocolate dyed brown.

The researchers from Hull York Medical School said the results were surprising but dark chocolate may be having an effect on the brain chemical serotonin. 

...

He explained: "Dark chocolate is high in polyphenols, which have been associated with health benefits such as a reduction in blood pressure.

"<strong>Also high polyphenols appear to improve levels of serotonin in the brain</strong>, which has been linked with chronic fatigue syndrome and that may be a mechanism."</blockquote>

Yes, serotonin: that chemical that is oh so similar to <a href="http://deoxy.org/dmt.htm" >dimethyltryptamine</a>. Enjoy your dark chocolate while you can, before it's outlawed as hallucinogenic!
