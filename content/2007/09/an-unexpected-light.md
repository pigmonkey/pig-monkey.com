Jason Elliot's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unexpected-Light-Afghanistan-Bestselling-Backlist/dp/0312288468" >An Unexpected Light: Travels In Afghanistan</a> is a beautifully written book, on par with <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/06/26/the-places-in-between/">The Places In Between</a>. The author's aimless wanderings in Afghanistan during the rise to power of the Taliban record the country and its people in an undeniably alluring way. He captures the daily life of Afghans throughout the country and, in his honest and provocative writing, the impact of decades of war.
