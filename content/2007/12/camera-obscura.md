The weekend before last my digital camera failed miserably during an attempted balancing trick on my handlebars: it fell and busted both the lens and the mechanism that opens and closes it. Luckily, it was only a point-and-click Canon PowerShot SD450 -- I've never been able to afford or justify a dSLR with my infantile skill. (Somebody want to buy me a Nikon D80? I'll love you long time.) So, I replaced it with a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=145&modelid=14901">Canon PowerShot SD1000</a> -- basically the upgrade to my old SD450 -- which arrived today.

And what image should I snap to test out the new device? Well, if there's one thing I've learned from my short time on Flickr, it's that all the cool kids take <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=moleskine&w=all">pictures of their Moleskine journals</a>. I thought I'd succumb to the meme and join the crowd.
