Bruce Schneir's <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/bruce-schneier-blazes-through-your-questions/" >recent admission that he keeps his passwords in his wallet</a> has been making rounds throughout the 'Net. I respect his opinion, but I must admit, the idea surprises me. I suppose it makes sense, since my wallet already holds other bits of precious of an equal value, but it seems to go against my natural paranoia. I do sometimes write new passwords down and carry them on me until I memorize them, but then I incinerate the piece of paper it was written on. And when I write the password, I do it on a piece of paper placed on a hard surface, so as to not unintentionally leave an impression on a notepad. Too paranoid? Maybe.

What if I encrypted the passwords with <a href="http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html" >Solitaire</a> and carried the cyphertext with me. Still too paranoid?
