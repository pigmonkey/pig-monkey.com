Even after last night's few flakes, I didn't believe the forecaster's call for snow this weekend. It seems much too early. But this morning I awoke to a good inch on the ground, and snow still falling (though it's getting a bit wet, now in the afternoon).

The Farmer's Market is dwindling, about a quarter of its usual size. Most vendors have retreated to the covered areas.
