So, things are looking a little different around here, no? I've had this design floating around in the grey-matter for a spell, but I didn't think I'd start on it for a while yet.

Then I got bored.

I whipped it up last night and today. A lot quicker than I thought. There's still a few tweaks I want to make, but it looks so much better than the last one, I decided to put it up before it was polished.

The design is very CSS heavy -- though "heavy" might not be the right descriptor, as the whole thing is rather quite light in terms of size. CSS dependent. How's that? The last few visions of this site have been CSS dependent, but in this one -- inspired in large part by <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> -- I've done my best to take out <em>all</em> styling from the pages and put it in the stylesheet. Of course, there's probably a bit of legacy styling lurking here-and-there in various old blog posts. Let me know if you stumble on any.

The design has been tested in Firefox on both OS X and Ubuntu, as well as Safari in OS X. Let me know if you stumble upon any bugs, unless you're using IE. Actually, if you're using IE and want to send in a screenshot, I'd be curious to see how the site renders.

I'm sure someone will be curious about the stripes. I put them in there as a joke and placeholder till I figured out what I wanted to do with the background, but hell if they don't look halfway decent. (It always ends up with me that some of the best design features start as jokes are bugs.) So, for now, they stay.
