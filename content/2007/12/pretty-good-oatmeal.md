Every Saturday morning, the first thing I do upon waking is go for run. After coming back and showering, I break-fast with this oatmeal, which I find to be mighty tasty.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
All ingredients I acquire from the bulk section of my local food co-op (except the honey, which comes from the farmer's market). Everything, of course, is organic.

<ul>
<li>4 oz. thick rolled oats</li>
<li>1 - 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons raisins</li>
<li>1 spoon full of honey</li>
<li>A pinch (or two) of sea salt</li>
</ul>

(For me, this makes one serving. Your mileage may vary.)

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Put the correct amounts of oats, sugar, and raisins in a container and set it aside.</li>
<li>Place 1 cup of water in a pot and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Dump in the oats, sugar, and raisins.</li>
<li>Add a pinch (or two) of sea salt.</li>
<li>Mix it up, allow everything to return to a full boil, then lower the heat to something around medium.</li>
<li>Watch it till the mixture becomes your preferred consistency, stirring occasionally. It usually takes 5-6 minutes for me.</li>
<li>When it looks to be about done, turn off the heat and mix in one whopping, overflowing spoon full of honey.</li>
<li>Let it cool for a minute or two, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
