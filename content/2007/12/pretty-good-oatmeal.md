Every Saturday morning, the first thing I do upon waking is go for run. After coming back and showering, I break-fast with this oatmeal, which I find to be mighty tasty.


## Ingredients

All ingredients I acquire from the bulk section of my local food co-op (except the honey, which comes from the farmer's market). Everything, of course, is organic.

* 4 oz. thick rolled oats
* 1 - 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons raisins
* 1 spoon full of honey
* A pinch (or two) of sea salt

(For me, this makes one serving. Your mileage may vary.)


## Directions

1. Put the correct amounts of oats, sugar, and raisins in a container and set it aside.
2. Place 1 cup of water in a pot and bring to a boil.
3. Dump in the oats, sugar, and raisins.
4. Add a pinch (or two) of sea salt.
5. Mix it up, allow everything to return to a full boil, then lower the heat to something around medium.
6. Watch it till the mixture becomes your preferred consistency, stirring occasionally. It usually takes 5-6 minutes for me.
7. When it looks to be about done, turn off the heat and mix in one whopping, overflowing spoon full of honey.
8. Let it cool for a minute or two, and enjoy!
