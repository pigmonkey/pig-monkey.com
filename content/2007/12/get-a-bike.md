>New streetcar tracks on Seattle's Westlake Avenue have turned into a trap for bicyclists.
>
>The tires on a standard road bike are narrower than the 1 3/4 inch groove that holds a streetcar wheel. If a bicycle veers into that gap, it can easily get stuck, pitching the rider onto the street.

>Despite the goal of Mayor Greg Nickels to triple bicycle use, the new streetcar line includes long stretches of track in the curb lanes of Westlake Avenue, where bicyclists normally ride. Many riders have adapted by riding on sidewalks, to the left of the tracks -- or in the left lane, which aggravates motorists.

Obviously, <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/11/12/save-your-face/">I agree</a>. Though I don't see an issue with just switching to the left lane. It may be an annoyance to those in motorized vehicles, but, honestly, that's their problem. If they can afford to buy a car, buy insurance, buy gas, and maintain their car, surely they can afford to slow down a bit and let us pass.
