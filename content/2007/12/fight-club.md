For the past two months, I've been attending <a href="http://www.unbridledmartialarts.com/index.htm" >Unbridled Martial Arts</a> -- or, as I refer to it, Fight Club. It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts" >mixed martial arts</a> club, mixed gender and of various skill levels. There is no belt-system, or ranking of any kind. Tuesday and Thursday nights are stand-up fighting, which draw from the likes of muay-thai, kickboxing, judo, American boxing, and karate. Wednesday nights are weapons and grappling. The weapons training is escrima, with the weapons themselves being escrima sticks and knives. Grappling draws from wrestling, Jujutsu, judo, Shamrok submission fighting, and Israeli self-defense.

There are no contracts, so class sizes vary. Usually attendance at the stand-up fighting class is around 16, and weapons/grappling about half of that.

Rob is the only instructor (though he sometimes draws on other students to assist). He's a great teacher, and somehow manages to split his attention throughout the class's various skill levels. During my first few sessions, I always felt that he gave full attention to us noobs, and now, I feel like he gives his attention to those of us slightly more experienced, even when we have a batch of beginners joining the class.

All the instruction is focused on real-world street self-defense. There are very few flashy moves.  I believe one could become a more effective fighter by studying a classic art, such as Aikido, for an extended period of time, but what's taught in Fight Club is skill enough to make one sufficient in a short period of time.
