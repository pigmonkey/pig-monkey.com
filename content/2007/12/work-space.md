I've been inspired by the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/unclutterer/pool/">Unclutterer Flickr pool</a>, of late. After discovering an over-due power bill buried under the liter on my desk, I decided it might be time for a cleaning.

One uncovers a number of artifacts from amidst the numerous papers. Writings of Hakim Bey, a copy of the the Canon of the Roman Catholic Mass, WPA attacks, The Laws of Manu, a not-yet-expired Montana fishing license (or "conservation license", as they would have), crypto algorithm discussions, lockpicking guides, a zine about bikes, a song book for an Ocarina, those fake press badges I got in Bangkok, satellite photos of UPS' local warehouse (I don't even remember why I have those)...

It still needs work, but the space has improved, and it does a deal of good for the mind.
