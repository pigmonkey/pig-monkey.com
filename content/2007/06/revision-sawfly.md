Being a member of the genetically defective, it's hard to find eyewear that both offers protection and allows me to see. Products from ESS, Wiley-X, and other top brands don't fit my prescription. Frames from Oakley would kill my budget before even ordering the prescription. Most everything else in the big-wide-world-of-eyewear is concerned only with looks, not with that inevitable situation of a projectile flying at 1300 feet per second  straight at you with intent to gorge your cornea.

This dilemma led me, after some time, to choosing the <a href="http://www.revisioneyewear.com/sawfly.html">Revision Sawfly Military Eyewear System</a>.

At first, I thought the glasses had a definite I'm-going-to-kill-your-family look to them, but now I'm telling my self it's just <span class="removed_link">cyberpunk</span>. (No word yet if Revision is planning to make mirror-shades.)

On top of the usual <a href="http://www.safetyglassesusa.com/ansiz8712003.html">ANSI Z87.1</a> certification, the Sawflys are able to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGXoTAJB_IU">withstand a shotgun blast from 16 feet</a>. Sure, if someone is firing a shotgun at your face from 16 feet, you've got other problems to worry about, but that's <em>quality</em>.

There are three lenses for the system: smoke, "high contrast" (yellow), and clear. (Polarized smoke lenses, pictured above, can also be purchased). High contrast lenses, while certainly frightening the masses and screaming "shoot me first!", are an important form of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inZUDMGJsKo">protection</a> from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHm_YSGnTY#t=0m30s">advertising, mind-control, and other-world-entities</a>.

The prescription insert is available for just $20 more. After hearing about Revision's great customer service, I decided to take a chance and have Revision also fill my prescription. It took about 4 weeks for them to get it to me, and I'm just as happy with them as I have been with any lenses purchased from a local optometrist.

It's too early for <a href="http://www.militarymorons.com/equipment/eyewear.html#sawfly">a review</a>, but my first impressions are positive. The "regular" size, with the adjustable arms, is a perfect fit for my face. The coverage is excellent -- my eyes no longer tear from cold air when screaming down hill at warp speed on my bike. As of yet, my only complaint is the large, plastic nosepad. It takes a little getting used to and, when sweating, I've found the glasses slip ever so slightly down my nose. Snapping on the included retention lanyard would fix this, but I would like to see Revision take the same rubber padding from the inside of the arms and adding this to the nosepad. I think this would increase both comfort and traction.
