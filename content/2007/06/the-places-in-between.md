There's a certain madness in walking across the most heavily land-mined country in the world, in the middle of winter, during a war -- but it clearly would make for a wonderful book. Rory Stewart's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Places-Between-Rory-Stewart/dp/0156031566" >The Places In Between</a> is just such a book. The portrait of Afghanistan, it's people, landscape and cultures in awe-some. It is a rare look that focuses not on the military history of the land, but of the people. The tale should be read by all.
