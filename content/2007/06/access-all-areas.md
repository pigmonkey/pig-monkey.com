I've always thought it strange that one would write a book about urban exploration. There doesn't seem to be a need for it. What more is there to say than 'don't be stupid' and 'don't get caught'? But Ninjalicious pulled it off with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0973778709/">Access All Areas: A User's Guide to the Art of Urban Exploration</a>. While the high points of the book are the author's stories of explorations, he offers an amount of good advice and even managed to expand my definition of the Art. It's also a superior piece on social engineering to Mitnick's The Art of Deception.

It's by no means a must-read, but if you are interested in UE, I think it's worth a skim in the bookstore.
