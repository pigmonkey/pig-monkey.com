<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Song-Called-Youth-Book/dp/1930235003/ref=sr_1_23/103-7735459-0904667?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1177741130&sr=1-23" >Eclipse</a> is Volume One of John Shirley's oft-overlooked cyberpunk trilogy, <a href="http://www.darkecho.com/JohnShirley/trilogy.html" >A Song Called Youth</a>.

In it, NATO and the Russians, fighting World War 3, have agreed to limit their warfare to only small-scale, tactical nukes -- painfully drawing out the death of the planet (and FirStep, the space colony). Behind the scenes is the Second Alliance, a sort of combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century" >PNAC</a>, Blackwater, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Camp" >Jesus Camp</a>. Worldtalk, a stand in for Newscorp, has developed a device allowing them to scan and selectively remove memory of their subjects. The New Resistance, a collection of fighters, refugees, philosophers (and a musician) headed by an ex-Mossad agent (with questionable funding and support), is the only hope against the neo-fascist-corpolitical takeover.

An excellent book, it is perhaps the most disturbing look at our corporate-dominated future. Shirley truly puts the punk in cyberpunk.
