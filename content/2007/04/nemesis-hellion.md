Last winter when <a href="http://tadgear.com/">TAD Gear</a> had their holiday sale, I picked up a <span class="removed_link">Nemesis Hellion</span>.

It's an nice little neck knife -- though I don't often carry it that way. I tend to tuck it away somewhere in my jacket, or sometimes a boot, as a last ditch resort for when all my other blades have receded into the void and the cardboard boxes are out for <em>blood</em>.

For when I do carry it around the neck, I replaced the chain with gutted paracord and wrapped the handle <a href="http://www.phlaunt.com/atwoodknives/16570807.php">Atwood style</a> (also with gutted paracord) to reduce the amount of cold metal touching my skin.

The Kydex sheath is a tight fit. It takes a few wiggles to get the knife loose, and the blade often comes out with black specs cut from the inside of the sheath. (At least you can be assured the knife isn't going to fall out and impale you in the toe.)

When it first came, the butt-end was almost as sharp as the tip. The next time I went out, I took a little sandstone to it and sanded it down.

Honestly, a knife this small doesn't have much application (unless you're Jack Bauer -- I'm sure he could find a use for it). It's more of a fun toy. I wouldn't pay the $39.99 TAD currently asks for it, but if you can find it cheaper, it's a well built blade and a worthy addition to any collection of Sharp Things.
