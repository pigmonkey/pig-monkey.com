<blockquote>As part of a growing state rebellion, Gov. Christine Gregoire today signed a bill rejecting REAL ID, a new federal identification system that would create a de facto national ID card. Legislatures in four other states -- Maine, Idaho, Arkansas and Montana -- also have adopted measures opposing REAL ID, and lawmakers in more than 20 other states are considering similar action.</blockquote>
