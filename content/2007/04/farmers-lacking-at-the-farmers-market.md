I went to the opening of the <a href="http://www.bellinghamfarmers.org/">farmer's market</a> today. It seems to be smaller this year. A whole row of vendors was missing, and the vendors that are there are mostly crafts -- much less produce.

My favorite apple stand was missing.

Hopefully the farmers will return and reclaim their market as the season continues.

On the plus side, my <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/12/01/connection/">honey</a> <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/02/28/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-nectar/">stock</a> is replenished and I'm sitting here with a bag of salmon jerky.
