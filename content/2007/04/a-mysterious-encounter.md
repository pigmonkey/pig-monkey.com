I was waiting at the bus stop today when a construction worker walked up to me. He stared at me for a few moments and said "Wow, you look impressive. Cargo pants and everything." I chuckled, told him thanks, and he went on his way.

About a minute later he came back and said "I don't want to bother you or anything, but I got to thinking a guy dressed like that could use some wheels." He handed me a business card and walked away. On the back was written:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.imz-ural.com" >www.imz-ural.com</a>
Gear-Up Model 2006
Download Manual</blockquote>

Now all I need is <a href="http://www.imz-ural.com/gearup/" >$10,995</a>.

The strange part is, this bus stop was in the middle of a large parking lot with no construction site around. When I turned around to see where he walked off to, he was gone.
