High hopes had I for this new-fangled <a href="http://maps.google.com/?t=p" >terrain view on Google Maps</a>. "Aha!" I said to myself, "This I shall use for planning new bike routes." But the inaccuracies are too great, the scale too small, and I'm left with my worn topo maps.

Paper, it seems, is not to be replaced.
