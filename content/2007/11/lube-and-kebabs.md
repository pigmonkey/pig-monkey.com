After tonight's sub-freezing <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/10/27/bellingham-critical-mass/">Critical Mass</a> (there were a few flakes of snow), I lubed my bike chain and treated myself to a couple kebabs, both of which combine to make an interesting aroma. I imagine my dreams tonight will involve beef and oil.

But for now, I will warm my fingers around a mug of kukicha.
