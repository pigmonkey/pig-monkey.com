This morning while putting on my pants, I noticed an immediate lack of gadgety-goodness. Frantic patting of my waist confirmed it: my Leatherman Wave was indeed missing, pouch and all! How does that happen? Granted, the pouch was showing age, and was of poor quality even in its youth, but, still -- did it just fall off?  The bike crash must have something to do with it. I <del>do</del> did wear the tool on the side that came came crashing down.

Now I need a new multitool. My experience with Leatherman has been good (sans pouch), so I think I'll stick with them. A skeletool, mayhap?
