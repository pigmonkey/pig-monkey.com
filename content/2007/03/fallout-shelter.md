Walking around town last weekend, I stumbled upon this old brick building with a "Fallout Shelter" sign on it.

Always good to know where your local bunkers are, I suppose. I imagine the thing is a remnant from the '50's or '60's and that it isn't stocked or maintained anymore. But, still, I doubt the <span class="removed_link">shambling masses of the undead</span> will be able to eat you in there.

Another possible bug-out location.
