Have you ever noticed that, with the majority of aid organizations, when you visit their website and head to their 'Get Involved' or 'Help Out' sections, they only ask for money? Or poster-ing? Perhaps, at best, they'll give you some office work. They never actually ask for people to go overseas. Never ask for people to help distribute the supposed aid. It doesn't quite help support the notion that these organizations are actually doing anything. They've got nobody in the field!
