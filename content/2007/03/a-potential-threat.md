<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/03/citizen_counter.html" >Schneier mentions a new "Citizen Counter-Terrorists" program in Manchester.</a> The hotline asks callers 10 questions concerning their potential terrorist neighbor. Let's see if I fit the bill.

<ol>
<li>Do you know anyone who travels but is vague on where they're going? <strong>Check</strong></li>
<li>Do you know someone with documents in different names for no obvious reason? <strong>Check</strong></li>
<li>Do you know someone buying large or unusual quantities of chemicals for no obvious reason? <strong>No</strong></li>
<li>Handling chemicals is dangerous, maybe you've seen goggles or masks dumped somewhere? <strong>Check</strong></li>
<li>If you work in commercial vehicle hire or sales, has a sale or rental made you suspicious? <strong>n/a</strong></li>
<li>Have you seen someone with large quantities of mobiles? <strong>No</strong></li>
<li>Have you seen anyone taking pictures of security arrangements? <strong>Check</strong></li>
<li>Do you know someone who visits terrorist-related websites? <strong>Check</strong></li>
<li>Have you seen any suspicious cheque or credit card transactions? <strong>Check</strong></li>
<li>Is someone is asking for a short-term let on a house or flat on a cash basis for no apparent reason? <strong>No</strong></li>
</ol>

Looks like I meet 6/10 of their requirements for being a terrorist. 60% isn't considered a passing grade, in my experience. Take that, you pesky neighbors!
