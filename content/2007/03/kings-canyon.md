I just accepted a job at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Canyon_National_Park" >Kings Canyon National Park</a>, in the southern Sierra Nevadas. I'll be there mid-June till mid-September.

The work is through <a href="http://thesca.org/" >SCA</a>, which was recommended to me by a friend at the WFR course. It only pays $60 a week -- enough for groceries, I think -- but the housing is free. From what I've been told, it's more-or-less impossible to get a real, actually-paying job with the Forest/Park service before you've done some sort of volunteer or internship thing with them. So at least this way I'm getting payed something.

The idea is, if I like the work, I can get a job as a seasonal Ranger. Work the summer and bum around the rest of the year.

Dates will be posted when I know them. I'll be driving, so some of you California people will have to offer to put me up for the night. (And then you should come visit me in the park.)
