Greetings from Portland. (Surprise?)

I'm staying in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_Portland,_Oregon" >Hawthorne District</a>, which so far seems to be an over-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill,_Seattle,_Washington" >Capitol Hill</a> -- same shops, even.

If anyone has suggestions for that which must be done or seen, let me know. I head home Friday.

<a href="http://trimet.org/" >Public transportation</a> here seems to be overpriced, but I can rent a bike for $15, so I think I might do that tomorrow. Walking around today, it looked this area was bike-friendly, but the other side of the Willamette River... not so much.
