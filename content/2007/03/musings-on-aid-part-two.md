Isn't it strange how people get degrees in fields related to NGO work?

It reflects the attitude that aid is an industry -- something permanent, instead of a sad necessity that must be temporarily pursued until governmental disputes can be settled or unfortunate weather events overcome.

The other day I met someone who was pursuing a degree in refugee assimilation. It doesn't make sense! She will be solving no problems -- only propagating old ones. (Though she will be guaranteed a steady stream of subjects.) Why not get a degree in "nonviolent conflict resolution" or, if that doesn't pack enough umph for you, "tactical warlord disposal" or "guerrilla warfare education for refugees". Something to cut the problem off at its source.
