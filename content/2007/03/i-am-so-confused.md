So I was sitting here, at work, doing work stuff, when a reminder popped up. "Work in 14 minutes". "Wait a second," I thought "I'm already at work." I check the calendar. I'm not supposed to be at work till 3. My (atomic) watch said it was 2:47. Time.gov agreed with it.

I'm supposed to be in class 2-3 -- but I went to that class. The professor was there, my friends were there.

Was the entire class an hour early?

Will I be late to my next class?

What time is it?

Tune in next week...
