It seems <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6446183.stm" >Iran is complaining</a> about their depiction in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0416449/" >300</a>.

<blockquote>It seeks to tell people that Iran, which is in the Axis of Evil now, has for long been the source of evil and modern Iranians' ancestors are the ugly murderous dumb savages you see in 300.</blockquote>

I must have missed something because, when I saw the film, the Spartans were clearly depicted as savage, inhuman barbarians.

The film-makers even drew a direct correlation between the Spartans and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur" >Timur</a>, with their wall of corpses. If Timur wasn't a war-mongering ass-hat, I don't know who was.
