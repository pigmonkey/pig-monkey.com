As part of an article on the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003625283_fortlewis19m.html" >increase of Fort Lewis soldiers in Iraq</a>, the Seattle Times today has an <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/zoom/html/2003625285.html" >image of the Stryker Brigrade</a> with a caption that reads
<blockquote>Soldiers from the 5th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team use smoke grenades for concealment as they engage <strong>anti-Iraqi</strong> forces in Baqubah last week.</blockquote>
It's interesting what they choose to title the Bad Guys&trade;. No longer rebels, insurgents, freedom fighters, or terrorists.

Anti-Iraqi. Certainly there are citizens of Iraq who disagree with the ideals of those getting smoked by the Stryker Brigade, but the term "anti-Iraqi" implies some sort of overwhelming consensus in the country that these people are wrong -- implies that the Sunni, Shi'ite and Kurds feel some sort of political unity, which I really don't see as the case. The country of Iraq is purely a <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq#Partitioning" >figment of the West's imagination</a>.

(On another note, is it just me, or are those guys in the picture wearing Multi-Cam? Shouldn't they be in ACU? Perhaps they grew tired of getting shot at due to crappy, useless -- not to mention ugly -- camo. Revolt!)
