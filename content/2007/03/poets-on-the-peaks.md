John Suiter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poets-Peaks-John-Suiter/dp/1582432945/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7675055-7947836?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1172988084&sr=8-1" >Poets on the Peaks: Gary Snyder, Phillip Whalen & Jack Kerouac in the North Cascades</a> is a biographical account of these Beat Bards, with emphasis placed on their wilderness outings and spiritual explorations, painting them as 20th century Thoreaus. 

This book -- the images, the text, the characters -- are beautiful. It renews the magic of this place.

A portrait of mountains and rivers and Buddha and zen and trees and poetry. America.
