A sort of manual for reprogramming you mind, it's the book that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quinn" >Daniel Quinn</a> would write if Quinn had been a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" >Freud</a>.

Through the interwoven stories, Zink challenges <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/14/nightwalking/">perception</a> and meaning, expounding that all is rooted in the mind, shifting the reader's experience of reality.
