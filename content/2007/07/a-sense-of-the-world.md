Jason Robert's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-World-Historys-Greatest-Traveler/dp/0007161069" >A Sense Of the World</a> is a biography of James Holman, the Blind Traveler. Living in the early 19th century, Holman traveled the world, not letting his blindness come in the way of his successful career as a writer or his circumnavigation of the globe. I found the book itself to be wanting in detail -- the sense of adventure in his travels is often missing -- though this is more likely due to the lack of source material than the author's talent. For those stricken with a case of wanderlust, or, as Roberts so skillfully puts it, the "freedom of abandon", this account of "poet turned warrior turned wanderer", the clear predecessor to <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/06/09/the-devil-drives/">Burton</a>, is a recommended read.
