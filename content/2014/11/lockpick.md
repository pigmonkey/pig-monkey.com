[Triple Aught Design](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/) is a small business. All of us wear multiple hats to make things go. Sometimes I end up wearing hats that may be considered odd in other businesses.

Today I got a call from our retail store manager. The key for the cash drawer at our [Hayes Valley Outpost](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/about/#hayes-valley-outpost-sf) had been accidentally locked inside the drawer. As the guy generally responsible for security-related things, and the lockpicker in the office, the retail team thought I could help.

I've carried a set of [Bogota picks](http://serepick.com/products/bogota-titan-entry-toolset--2.html) in my wallet every day for a number of years. The popularity of the Bogota picks is well-deserved, but I found that this particular lock was too small for me to insert both the pick and the tension wrench. Fortunately I just picked up a pair of [Kelly Alwood](http://www.kellyalwood.com/)'s [ALS Mini Flats](http://www.survivalcorner.com/als-mini-flats/) a couple weeks ago, and happened to have those in my pack. I don't like the picks as much, but the tension wrench has a nice small tip that left me just enough room to insert the single hook Bogota pick. Between the ALS wrench and the Bogota pick I had the drawer opened shortly, and recovered the key.

Unfortunately I did not get to keep what was inside.

On the wall of the Outpost we have the well-known [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein) quote, which is something of a driving force for what we do at Triple Aught Design, and struck me as appropriate today.

 > A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
