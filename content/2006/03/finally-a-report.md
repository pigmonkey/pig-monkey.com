<a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/12/quest/" >The trip</a> deviated from the plan, but was still a success, thanks to me keeping my expectations open.
It's hard not to enjoy oneself in the natural world.

Originally, I'd planned to park somewhere in the Redwoods and hike up to a "primitive campsite" with my pack. The first deviation came when I discovered that I'd be charged $15 p/ night just to park -- the same as what was charged to camp in a normal camp site. On top of that, there was self-registration available for normal camping, but not for the primitive camp (it was off-season, so the visitor's center was closed). So, I decided to camp at the normal site.

I'd also agreed to give Wade, my friend at the University of Oregon, a ride back to Seattle and, since we'd be driving up the coast, his roommate, Jordon, a ride to Astoria, which meant I'd have to be back in Eugene on Thursday.

<b>Saturday</b>
Left home in the morning.
I took i-5 down to Eugene, arriving early in the evening. After meeting up with Wade and some of his friends at the University of Oregon, we went to explore <a href="http://www.friendsofhendrickspark.org/" >Hendricks Park</a>.
Dinner at the Laughing Planet Cafe and dessert at <a href="http://www.sweetlifedesserts.com/" >Sweet Life</a>.
I spent the night on a spare bed in the dorms.

<b>Sunday</b>
Left Eugene early in the morning.
I took OR-126 out to the coast, where I got on 101 and headed south. I entertained myself throughout the drive by stopping at lots of parks and scenic pull-offs.
(I don't know why Bellingham is so renowned for biker gangs -- southern Oregon certainly has more.)
I ended up reaching the California border as the sun was going down and decided to spend the night in a hotel in Crescent City, CA.

<b>Monday</b>
Left Crescent City in the morning and drove about 20 miles south to <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=415" >Prairie Creek State Park</a>. After discovering that I'd be spending my time in the Redwoods in a normal campsite, I decided to check out the site at the beach to see if I liked it better. The drive there started out simple enough -- another 5 minutes on 101. Then I reached the turn-off to the site and discovered a rather large puddle in my way -- deep enough that the water level was about halfway up my tires. Shortly after that, the pavement ended and the road turned into a dirt trail completely covered with pot-holes. It wasn't very fun to try to navigate, but I made it through. After finally reaching the beach, the road deteriorated even more (I didn't think it was possible). On top of the pot-holes doubling in size, there was a huge cliff to my right, which worried the Geologist inside of me. A few more minutes on that road and I reached the campsite, but decided that with the road, the cliff, and the wind, I preferred the camp site at the visitor's center. So I turned right around, navigated the horrible road, drove through the puddle, and went back to the first site. After paying and setting up camp, I wandered around the smaller trails near the camp for a little bit before the sun started going down.
After that, I ate dinner with the Elk (who are so "dangerous" that they'll come right into your campsite to graze without paying you any mind), read a little in my book, and went to bed with the Sun.
Not a bad Equinox.

<b>Tuesday</b>
Woke up with the sun.
After having breakfast with the Quail, I threw some snacks and toilet paper in my camelbak and headed off for a day of exploration. I walked all around the park, exploring misty Forest. At one point I was stalked by what looked to be a Mountain Lion, but I never saw any bears -- perhaps they were still hibernating. I returned to the camp as the sun was going down, and had dinner. It was extremely painful to walk around camp that night, but I didn't end up with any blisters.
Went to bed with the Sun.

<b>Wednesday</b>
Woke up with the sun.
Since I had to be back in Eugene on Thursday, I decided I'd make half of the journey today. After wandering around the shorter trails that I'd explored Monday, I packed up the camp and got back on 101. I reached the site that I intended to stay at in the afternoon (a little south of Reedsport, OR). It didn't seem worth it to me to set up my tent for just one night, so I decided that I'd sleep in the car that night. After paying the camp site fee, I ventured off to explore the sand dunes. Since I had no map of the area, all the dunes looked rather similar, and the wind was beginning to erase my tracks, I decided to cut that adventure short, but not without having a little fun.
After arriving back at the camp, I snacked a bit and read my book. At one point, some lady came driving up to the site (I assume she must have been the camp host, a concept which I was only introduced to when I arrived at Prairie Creek). She rolled down her window and asked if I needed help. I said no. (I only ever realize this after the fact, but, for some reason, people always ask me if I need help when they're confused. I don't know why they can't just say what they mean -- they're obviously the ones that need help. I always take the question literally and reply no.) After that she asked if I knew that I was in a campsite -- that seemed rather insulting, but, since this was my first contact with civilization in a few days, I assumed that in her eyes I might somehow seem strange and just needed to adjust back to their ways. After a little more dancing around the subject, I realized what she wanted to know if I had paid or not. Why she couldn't just have asked that in the first place, I don't know. I pointed to the receipt that was pinned to the post at the entrance to the site, literally right in front of her. She drove off, and I went back to reading. As the sun went down, I got into my car and went to sleep, but woke up often and wasn't very comfortable -- sleeping in the car apparently isn't for me.

<b>Thursday</b>
Woke up with the sun and drove back to Eugene.
Wade had a final at 3pm, so we decided to leave Friday morning. We wandered around campus a bit, only to come back to the dorm and find that I'd gotten a $20 ticket for parking in a permitted lot without a permit. I paid that, then drove over to his friend's house to avoid getting another ticket. After a couple hours hanging out there, two of the people wanted to go to a show in Portland, but I was blocking them in. So I went out to move my car, and discovered that I'd locked the keys in the ignition -- something I've never done before. (I think my car was getting back at me for sleeping in it.) The locksmith was quick and only cost $35, so it wasn't too bad. We hung out in the dorms that night, but I was still on Forest time, so I had to go to bed soon after the sun went down.
Spent the night on a couch at one of Wade's friend's house.

<b>Friday</b>
Woke up a bit after the sun.
I drove back to the dorms to get Wade and Jordon up. After they packed, we drove out to the coast and got back on 101 -- this time going North to Astoria, OR. We made good time, stopping only at the <span class="removed_link">Tillamook Cheese Factory</span> because Jordon said it was a law that if you drove through Tillamook, you had to stop (and I wanted ice cream). A few miles south of Astoria, we pulled off at a turn around and jumped the barrier. Jordon led us through the bush, out to a cliff he knew about with a view. We arrived in Astoria just as the sun went down. Jordon's parents took us out to dinner, and then we hung out at a friend's house.

<b>Saturday</b>
We explored Astoria a bit more, then Wade and I got back on the road again. We headed north on 101 for a while, headed East to Olympia, then got back on i-5 and went home, arriving at about 7pm.
