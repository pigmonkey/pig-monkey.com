I've signed up for a <span class="removed_link">3-Day Survival Walk-about</span> in mid June. It should be interesting -- I've never done anything like it before.
<blockquote>
If you have ever wanted to relate to the earth without the conveniences of our modern world, this is the experience for you. The 3-Day Survival Walk-about is designed to allow people to touch nature in a pure and unmediated manner, to experience the freedom of walking across a landscape and trusting in the earth to provide for all of our needs.

Participants will walk into the wilderness with only a knife and water purifiers, and we'll learn and apply survival skills as the need for them arises. Involving shelter building, harvesting edible plants, navigation techniques and fire-making, this wander gives you the opportunity to experience nature in an ancient and meaningful way.</blockquote>
