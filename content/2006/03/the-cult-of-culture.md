By far the greatest <a href="http://deoxy.org/mckenna.htm" >Terence McKenna</a> lecture I've yet experienced is his <a href="http://www.matrixmasters.com/podcasts/TerenceMcKenna/TerenceMcKenna-Denver-1999.mp3" >Culture and Ideology are not your friends</a>, given in Denver, April 1999.

And for the amount of time I spend listening to Terence, that's saying something.

<blockquote>"This is a struggle between novelty and habit . . . [Your culture] is the greatest barrier to your enlightenment, your education, and your decency . . . Cultures are virtual realities made of language."</blockquote>
