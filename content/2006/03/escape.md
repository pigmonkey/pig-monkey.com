Sometimes one needs to return to the real world and escape all the concrete.

I spent last night at the <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/01/28/arboretum-shelter/" >shelter</a> in the <a href="http://whatcom.kulshan.com/Washington/Whatcom_County/Bellingham/Sehome/Outdoors/Sehome_Arboretum.htm" >Arboretum</a>. It was surprisingly cold out, even though the weather report said it wasn't supposed to get below 37F and I was sleeping in a 30F bag. I didn't encounter the cougar that I hear lives in there, but a few owls did come out. Surprisingly I also heard people walking around in the middle of the night.
