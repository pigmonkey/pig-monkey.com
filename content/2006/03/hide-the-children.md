<blockquote>(When it comes to hacking sites on the web, it really depends on your perspective as to who's a good guy and who's not.  Just because someone has exploits on their site, it doesn't mean they're evil, but they're probably not saints either.  Anyway, some hats are blacker than others; these are mostly various shades of gray and will hopefully give you a feel for what's going on in the hacking underground. Some may contain offensive content. Proceed at your own risk!)
