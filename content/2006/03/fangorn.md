I'm packed and ready to <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/12/quest/" >take off</a>.

To be a little more specific, I'll be around the southern part of <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=415" >Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park</a>, a part of the forest that's been described to me as "Tolkienesque".
