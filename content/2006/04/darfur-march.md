I went to the Darfur march today. It started off with a few speakers at Westlake -- including a 6th grader and a few highschool students -- and then we marched down to the Federal Building and had a "die-in". When we reached the Federal Building, the police had the entrance tied off with caution tape. I guess one sit-in a week is all they want. 

There were only a hundred or so people during the speeches, but that number seemed to grow after we started marching.
