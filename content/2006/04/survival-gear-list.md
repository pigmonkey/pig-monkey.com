The pack surprised me. I thought they would allow only the clothes on your body. Speaking of clothes, that they recommended shorts was also surprising. Not only are they not very popular (or practical) here in the Pacific Northwest, but they also don't offer much protection while tramping through the bush. I'll stick with pants.

I've never heard of the <a href="http://www.swedishknives.com/" >knife</a> they recommend. I'll be bringing a <span class="removed_link">Becker Knife and Tool Crewman</span>.
