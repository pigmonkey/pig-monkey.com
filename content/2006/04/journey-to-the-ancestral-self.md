<a href="http://www.teachingdrum.org/" >Tamarack Song</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0882681788/sr=8-1/qid=1144017296/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-3693372-7552163?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >Journey to the Ancestral Self</a> is an attempt to lay out a life philosophy that encompasses believes of all Native people. (It's always strange, learning about stuff like this from a <a href="http://teachingdrum.org/gallery/marcus/tamarack_coulor" >white guy</a>.) I think the book fails in its goal, but succeeds in describing Tamarack's own ideas -- heavily influenced by Native thinking.

Much of the book is very similar to <a href="http://www.navaching.com/hawkeen/hawkindex.html" >Hawkeen Training</a>. I enjoyed it a good bit, and will probably continue reading more of his books (and reread this one).
