<blockquote>
For the last few years, a coalition of technology companies, academics and
computer programmers has been trying to persuade Congress to scale back the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Now Congress is preparing to do precisely the opposite. A proposed copyright
law seen by CNET News.com would expand the DMCA's restrictions on software
that can bypass copy protections and grant federal police more wiretapping
and enforcement powers.

...

During a speech in November, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales endorsed the
idea and said at the time that he would send Congress draft legislation.
Such changes are necessary because new technology is "encouraging
large-scale criminal enterprises to get involved in intellectual-property
theft," Gonzales said, adding that proceeds from the illicit businesses are
used, "quite frankly, to fund terrorism activities."

...

Smith's measure would expand those civil and criminal restrictions. Instead
of merely targeting distribution, the new language says nobody may "make,
import, export, obtain control of, or possess" such anticircumvention tools
if they may be redistributed to someone else.
