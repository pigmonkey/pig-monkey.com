Yesterday, I decided to give the <span class="removed_link">latest Ubuntu beta</span> a go. I first tried to upgrade using Ubuntu's update-manager, but, alas, GUIs never work. It crashed while trying to upgrade Kino, which also left me with a broken X server. I had downloaded the new Live CD beforehand, so I just booted into that and used the <span class="removed_link">installer</span>. The partitioning tool insisted that my new swap was to be only 1K, which I wasn't too pleased with. After killing the installer, manually setting my partitions with fstab, and then rerunning the installer, everything worked fine. By the time I rebooted, there were already 65 packages to update. After that, I had to add in some new repos and <a href="http://easylinux.info/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper#Add-On_Applications" >install the usual additional software</a>.

So far, I'm happy with the release. It seems a bit faster, looks much nicer, and, of course, has a whole slew of updated software.
