Slug: blacklist

I spent most of yesterday playing with <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/" >SpamAssassin</a>, ending up <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/SpamAssassin#Installing_v3.1.0_into_your_account" >installing my own copy</a> instead of using Dreamhost's instance. It seems to be working, more or less, but will take some time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_filtering" >train</a>. If you send me an email sometime within the next month, and I don't reply within a few days (and your message warranted a response), try to send it to me again. Or contact me through other means.

(I will be checking my "Spam of Death" folder for false-positives and correcting them, but you never know.)
