Tonight I went to a $2 showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/" >A Scanner Darkly</a>, a very good film. Though there are some significant changes, I don't think fans of the novel will be disappointed. The general feel of the book is there, and the main plot and characters remain intact. On the downside, they didn't really get across the whole Fred/Bob disconnect idea very well, and their representation of the scramble suits weren't exactly what I had in mind -- but, hell, the whole book is pretty hard to transfer to film. It stands as a good film on its own, and should please any who would have an interest in seeing it. Certainly superior to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337/" >the</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/" >last</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100802/" >few</a> Hollywood interpretations of Philip K. Dick's work.
