I picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Benjamin-Franklin/dp/0020029101/ref=sr_11_1/002-3538336-7708868?ie=UTF8" >Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</a> at one of those library book sales a few years ago for something like $1. It's been sitting on my bookshelf, neglected, ever since -- though I kept telling myself I'd read it one day. Finally, I have.

I enjoyed the book a good deal. Though I can't say I agree with all of Franklin's politics or his racist leanings, I did enjoy the writing style and the insight into the times. It's impressive how varied a man he was, seemingly every institution and employment being touched by him at some point. (And the book only goes to 30 years before his death.) I wouldn't use the book as a mold to shape my life to, which was the book's intention, but it's still a good read.
