Hitchhiking, to me, has always seemed a rather spontaneous act. Not something that required much technique -- find a spot and stick you thumb out. So I was intrigued when I first heard of James MacLaren's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/-Hitchhikers-Handbook/dp/1559501251/sr=8-2/qid=1158787450/ref=sr_1_2/104-4394858-5855113?ie=UTF8&s=books" >The Hitchhiker's Handbook</a>. How could someone write a book on such a simple subject? When I learned it was published by the now defunct <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/09/goodbye-loompanics/">Loompanics</a>, I had to buy it.

The book turned out to be full of nothing but common sense -- I'm still not sure how he stretched it out to 145 pages. On top of that, the author comes off as being a homophobe with not but a 6th grade writing education and a broken caps-lock. One's time would be much better spent browsing the information found on <a href="http://www.digihitch.com/" >Digihitch</a>.
