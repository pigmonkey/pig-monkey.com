Moving back to the 'ham tomorrow. I won't have interweb in my place for probably a week or two, but I'm going back to work sometime midweek so I'll probably be cruising a bit there. (Not that I would be using State resources for my own, personal use. No, sir.)

I imagine that, with my location, there oughta be some wifi I can <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/images/firewall.jpg" >hire Harrison Ford to haxx0r</a>, too.
