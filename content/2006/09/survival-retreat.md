Ragnar Benson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Survival-Retreat-Total-Plan-Defense/dp/0873642759/sr=8-2/qid=1159214334/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-5488538-1250319?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Survival Retreat: A Total Plan for Retreat Defense</a> is a whacky little book. It focuses on suggestions for locating, building, and stocking fallout shelters for surviving anything from economic collapse to nuclear war. Published in 1983, the book contains a lot of that Cold War paranoia. It does have a number of good tips, though the author has some mental issues he should probably work on.
