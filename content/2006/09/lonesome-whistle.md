<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0972385614/">Lonesome Whistle</a> is Duffy Littlejohn's collection of short stories about hopping freights. I found it to be hit and miss -- certainly inferior to <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/09/18/ridin-free/" >Ridin' Free</a>. At times, the tales seem to be more about sex and booze than trains. But it's another take on the hobo life. One worth looking at, I suppose.
