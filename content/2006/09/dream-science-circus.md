Yesterday's <a href="http://dreamsciencecircus.com/" >Dream Science Circus</a> was awesome. Located in a field out near Fairhaven, it was primarily a kid's show, but I loved it. Lots of wacky people dancing around in the air, a funny ring master, and audience interaction.

Something of an underground Cirque du Soleil. But only $10. And local.
