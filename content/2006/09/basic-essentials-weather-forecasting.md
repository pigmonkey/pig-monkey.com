It was staring up at the sky one day at the NVC that I decided to learn what the clouds meant. So, upon return, I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Essentials-Weather-Forecasting-2nd/dp/0762704780/sr=8-1/qid=1159464759/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-1811592-0051116?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Basic Essentials Weather Forecasting</a> by Michael Hodgson. The book serves as a short introduction to the topic of amateur weather forecasting, a chapter of it devoted to the science of clouds. The subject, I think, is not for me -- a lot of it went over my head (too many big words like cumulonimbus) -- but I did manage to take a good deal from the book. I'd recommend it for anyone who spends a deal of time in the outdoors, as the ability to predict <span class="removed_link">stormy weather</span> is a useful one.
