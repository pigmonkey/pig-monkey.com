Danien Leen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freighthoppers-Manual-North-America-Century/dp/0963291270/sr=8-1/qid=1158865875/ref=sr_1_1/002-5971209-0055259?ie=UTF8&s=books" >The Freighthopper's Manual For North America</a> is a short, concise guide for the would-be hobo. Originally printed in the '70s, this edition was "updated" in 1992 -- meaning he added a couple useful appendices. The main part of the book, though, still feels out of date, mentioning reefers and cabooses. The whole book is only about 100 pages, about a third of that pictures. It's a nice little manual to blow through in an hour or so, but by no means a replacement for Littlejohn's <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/09/09/hopping-freight-trains-in-america/">Hopping Freight Trains in America</a> (which I'm quickly discovering is the modern bible on the subject).

The book is a little hard to come by. I didn't have much trouble finding a used copy online, but there's also a stamp in the back of the book that reads:
<blockquote>ADDITIONAL COPIES OF THIS
UNIQUE BOOK ARE AVAILABLE
FOR $8.95 (U.S.) POSTPAID
FROM: DANIEL LEEN BOX 191
SEATTLE, WA 98111 U.S.A.</blockquote>
I don't know if that box is still valid, but it may be worth a shot.
