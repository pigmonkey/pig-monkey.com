Today I finished reading Boston T. Party's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bulletproof-Privacy-Hidden-Happy-Free/dp/1888766026/sr=8-1/qid=1157516638/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-2117679-6683332?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Bulletproof Privacy</a>. The book attempts to teach one how to live off the radar, but within Civilization. It covers topics such as building identities, anonymous addresses, bugging out, and the like. Published in 1997, much of the information is dated (I skipped the part on airplane travel). Other parts are common sense, but the book does provide a few gems of information. I'd recommend giving it a skim if you're considering becoming invisible (or would just like the ability to do so).
