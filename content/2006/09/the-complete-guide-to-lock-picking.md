I find that when talking to lock specialists, I'm always referred to it at one point or another. It's a short book. At only 80 pages, it obviously isn't very indepth. I found the author to brush over some topics too quickly, and was also lacking in pictures to help reinforce concepts. But all in all, the book taught me a good deal. Now I need to invest in a pick set.
