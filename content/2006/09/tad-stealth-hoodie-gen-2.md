<a href="http://tadgear.com" >TAD</a> has released the second generation of their <span class="removed_link">Stealth Hoodie Tactical Soft Shell</span>.  The big change seems to be in their new "rhino" fabric. Other than that, some small changes in the hood design, and new cuffs, the jacket doesn't look to be much different from the first generation, which I've owned in <span class="removed_link">ME Green</span> for about 9 months now. I've been meaning to write a review of it, but, until I do, suffice it to say that I love it and was worth the money.
