<a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=outn03&date=20060903" >Talk is that camp site fees are being increased</a>. They charge too much already. I prefer finding a nice, secluded spot in a National Forest, but that isn't always available. And it can be nice to have a bathroom.

In <a href="http://villagebooks.com/">Village Books</a> last week, I happened upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ray-Guides-Campgrounds-Washington-State/dp/0972552243/sr=1-10/qid=1158530806/ref=sr_1_10/104-7899427-8081569?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Ray's Guides: Free Campgrounds in Washington State</a>. The book is a no-nonsense list of free camp sites in the state. I've yet to have a chance to check out any of the listed sites, but hope to soon. <a href="http://www.raysguides.com/">Ray also has guides for Oregon and Idaho</a>.
