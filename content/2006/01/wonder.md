When I came <span class="removed_link">back</span> from <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2006/01/06/they-dont-allow-sharp-objects-on-the-train/">Vancouver</a> last Sunday, I discovered a package waiting for me. It was a <a href="http://alexgrey.com/shop/wonder-1.html" >poster</a> of <a href="http://alexgrey.com/" >Alex</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grey" >Grey</a>'s Wonder.

Wonder, beyond being a stunning piece of art, holds special significance for me. When I first saw it as the backdrop for the MutantFest flyer that <a href="http://crimethinc.com/" >Crimethinc</a> sent me a couple years ago, it was not only the first of Alex Grey's work that I had seen. It was the <span class="removed_link">first time I'd heard of The Autonomous Mutant Festival</span>, which introduced me to the idea of the T.A.Z., "a harmonious relationship with the earth", and many of the other memes that shape my life.
