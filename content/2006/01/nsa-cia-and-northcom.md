<span class="removed_link">William Arkin sheds more light</span> on the NSA's recent <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_3431085" >move</a>.
<blockquote>Aurora is already a reconnaissance satellite downlink and analytic center focusing on domestic warning. The NSA and CIA join U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) in Colorado. NORTHCOM is post 9/11 the U.S. military command responsible for homeland defense.

According to Government Executive Magazine -- thanks DP -- "NSA is building a massive data storage facility in Colorado, which will be able to hold the electronic equivalent of the Library of Congress every two days." This new NSA data warehouse is the hub of "data mining" and analysis development, allowing the eavesdropping agency to develop and make better use of the unbelievabytes of data it collects but does not exploit.</blockquote>

Speaking of spying, according to the Army <a href="http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/2006/01/us_army_collecting_information.html" >there is no absolute ban on [military] intelligence components collecting U.S. person information</a>.
