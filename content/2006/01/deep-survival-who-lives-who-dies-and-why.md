When I first received Laurence Gonzales' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393326152/qid=1138426316/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4688011-8599153?n=507846&s=books&v=glance" >Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why</a>, I expected it to be a dry survival manual -- specific solutions to specific situations. After the few few pages of the book, my expectations were quickly shot to the ground and the book managed to raise itself to the status of one of the best books I've ever read. Rather than dry disaster reports and analysis, I found the book to be part brain science, part stoic philosophy, and part zen teachings. It is a survival manual, but not like anything you expect. I highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of your interest in wilderness, as, more than anything, it's a book about how to live.
