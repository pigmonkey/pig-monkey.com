Democracy Now's parent station, Pacifica Radio, has <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/fordfoundationciaandgatekeepers11oct05.shtml" >apparently been funded by the Ford Foundation -- a CIA front</a>.
<blockquote>Take Pacifica / DEMOCRACY NOW, an alternative radio network with annual revenues of $10 million in 2000, whose National Program Director was paid $63,000 in that year. In the early 1950s--when the CIA was using the Ford Foundation to help fund a non-communist "parallel left" as a liberal Establishment alternative to an independent, anti-Establishment revolutionary left--the Pacifica Foundation was given a $150,000 grant in 1951 by the Ford Foundation's Fund for Education. According to James Ledbetter's book Made Possible By..., "the Fund's first chief was Alexander Fraser, the president of the Shell Oil Company."</blockquote>
