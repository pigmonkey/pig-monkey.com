Tonight I'm heading back down south to pick up <a href="http://ncdesign.net/" >Nick</a>. He's spending the night here in Bellingham and, tomorrow, we're taking the train up to Vancouver, B.C. for the <a href="http://rantmedia.ca/" >Rant</a> Meet, to celebrate RantMedia's seventh birthday. 

We'll both be in Vancouver from 11:40AM on Saturday till 6:00PM on Sunday and only have plans Saturday night, so if you're in the area or have suggestions for entertainment, you should email me (no later than tonight), call me (if you have the number), or email my phone (mobile@pig-monkey.com -- short messages only).

We're staying in a <span class="removed_link">hostel on Granville Street</span>.

The Seattle-Chicago Empire Builder will originate and terminate in Edmonds, with substitute bus service between Seattle and Edmonds.</blockquote>
