I'm heading up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Baker" >Baker</a> in a couple hours and spending the night for an Avalanche Awareness course. I already have plenty to say about it (the lecture portion was last night), but no time to write it down.

I should be back Saturday night around 8-9PM.

In unrelated news: Check out In the Wake's latest blog post ("Coming up on In the Wake") for the questions I sent in a couple days ago.
