<blockquote>Hey Pig Monkey,

   We noticed that one month from today is the 4 year anniversary of 
when you first began hosting with us! Time flies, eh? 

   As a thank you for your loyalty/patronage/what have you we have
created a $20 DreamHost gift certificate for you! This email is it! You can 
use the gift certificate on your own account (greedy!) or you can send 
it to somebody else!</blockquote>
I switched to Dreamhost in April 2002.
