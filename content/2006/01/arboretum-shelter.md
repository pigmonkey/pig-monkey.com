When Mike and I were hiking around in the <a href="http://www.cob.org/services/recreation/parks-trails/sehome-arboretum.aspx">Arboretum</a> a few months ago (the same day I <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2005/10/25/take-the-quick-way-down/" >fell off a cliff</a>), we discovered a man-made shelter of sorts, hiding well off any trails. Yesterday, I went back there alone and took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=shelter&w=17680393%40N03">photos, along with some video and commentary</a> for all to enjoy. Of course, I'm not going to say exactly where it is -- I don't want it to be destroyed -- but, if you ask me, I'll take you there.

Sometime in the spring, I may try to spend a few nights there.
