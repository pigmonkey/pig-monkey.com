Peter Jenkins' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006095955X/sr=8-1/qid=1150758681/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0565404-8138420?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >A Walk Across America</a> is a book I began hating but ended up loving. The tale of one man's walk across the East of 1970's America, it's something of an <em>On the Road</em>. I don't feel that Jenkins is a terrific writer, but the tales put down in this book are inspiring. It humanizes America.
