In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553379011/sr=8-1/qid=1150174487/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-6614013-9688032?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >The Story of B</a>, Daniel Quinn continues the teachings first layed out in <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/06/11/ishmael/" >Ishmael</a>. Through B, he furthers his criticism of Civilization by continuing to attack agriculture as its base, and expounding a great deal on religion. Indeed, the majority of the book is devoted to religious issues. Quinn classifies the major religions of the East and West -- Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- all as salvationist religions, meaning that they're all of the opinion that man needs to be saved. He shows this as a result of the development of agriculture and a demonstration that collapse is coming, and has been coming for quite a while.
It is certainly a book that fans of Ishmael will enjoy and, if you haven't read Ishmael yet, what are you doing wasting your time here?
