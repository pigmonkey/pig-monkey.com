<strong>I.</strong> Own only that which you must presently use, for all else is deceit. Use little, as virtue is derived from experience, not consumption.

<strong>II.</strong> Simplicity is virtue. The most beautiful form of simplicity is the elegant circle of self-sufficient consumption and creation. In all forms of accounting, do not consume more than you have already created.

<strong>III.</strong> Virtue is found not in secrecy or in the constraint of freedom, but in acknowledgement, and accepting responsibility for all costs of one's actions.

<strong>IV.</strong> Understanding the universe of connection is virtue. Connect with space through silence. Connect with time through experience. Free yourself from ego through awareness. Protect transcendent beauty.
