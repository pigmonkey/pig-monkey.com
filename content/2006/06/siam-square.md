I'm in Siam Square now. A place called MBK Center. It's an 8 story shopping mall, pretty much. The internet cafe here is nice. They advertise 8Mbps and AMD 64-bit processors. Not very secure though, if you know what I mean.

I never did go to the National Museum today. Instead, I got lost and walked around the city for 3 hours. I think I'm getting over the heat now -- though I say that sitting here in an air-conditioned mall. No, I don't think I am getting over it. I'm drinking a lot more water, though. That helps.

7-11 here is like Starbucks in the States. There's one on every corner, and if there isn't room in a building, they setup in a booth on the sidewalk. A large bottle of water is 9 Baht. I've probably gone through 5 today. I'm really going to have to pee tonight.

Did you know that your body uses a lot of heat keeping your pee warm? So if you're setting down for a cold night in the woods, take a good piss before bed so that your body can use that heat for better purposes. Random fact from survival training.

There's a Baskin Robbins here. I had a scoop of chocolate. Man, that was good. They brought me a glass of ice water, too. Ice is generally a no-no here, but it looked to cold too pass up. So if I die in the next day or two, sue Baskin Robbins.

I'm debating whether I want to see a movie or not. There's three theatres in the Siam Square area. All of them are playing Superman Returns, except for the one in this building, which is also showing Tokyo Drift. Neither of the films really appeal to me. There's ads for Dead Man's Chest all over the city.

Today is my last day in Bangkok. At least that was the idea. Now I'm starting to like the city. I don't know. Maybe I'll head north tomorrow, maybe I won't. This is the last night I have reserved at the Suk 11, though.

I was planning on heading over to the station today to seeing about getting a train or bus ticket to somewhere for tomorrow, but that never happened. So I guess I'll just wing that -- hopefully I can buy the ticket a few hours before departure. I'm thinking about heading to Ayuthaya, and from there to Chiang Mai. Perhaps I'll stop at Lopburi, but that seems to be the same thing as Ayuthaya, plus gangs of monkeys.

The Buddhist monks walking around the city aren't exactly what I was expecting. Something about monks with cell phones and digital cameras just doesn't seem right. I saw a tour bus full of monks at one Wat.

The Speakeasy speed test says I'm getting 1.4k down and 134k up. That's from the Seattle node.

I clicked on the little thing that was giving me a count down of how much time I have left and now it went away. Doh.

The food stalls in Bangkok are awesome. I've been snacking all day. But I think I might grab dinner here. Did I mention there's a KFC and McDonald's? Depressing.

It's sad that us Farang have to be so weary of Thai approaching us in the street. The vast majority are incredibly friendly. This morning while I was walking down the street from the hostel, two guys at a tuk-tuk stopped me. One tried to tell me that the Grand Palace was closed today, but the other guy shut him up. He said that traffic was too bad for a tuk-tuk, thus giving up money for himself. He then said I should take a motorcycle and, when I agreed, ran down the block to get me one. I was worried that the driver would try to take me to some silk/gem shop or some other scam, but he went straight to the Grand Palace and asked for the previously agreed upon price. Throughout the day, other Thais stopped me on the street. Some wanted me to buy something or tried to tell me something was closed, but the majority just wanted to talk. They always get excited when they hear I'm an American. Not sure why.

As nice as this mall is, the Thai music is getting to me. Not as bad as Japanese pop, but bad. I think -- yup, they're playing Spice Girls now.

I went to a weapon museum in the Grand Palace today. There was a whole lot of blades there. Guns, too. Speaking of which, I stumbled upon this two block stretch that was nothing but gun shops. I bet I could walk out of there with enough arms to start a small army, with not even an ID check. Bangkok is funny like that. They should have filmed Blade Runner here.

Well, I think I'm going to see about dinner. Long live the king, and all that.
