It always confuses the hell out me when people say Washington and end up referring to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=washington+dc&om=1" >that other Washington</a>, but now people in D.C. are <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyid=2006-06-01T140823Z_01_L31659378_RTRUKOC_0_US-WITNESS-TAGTOWN1.xml&src=rss" >being called Washingtonians</a>. This just isn't going to work. Someone is going to have to change their name.
