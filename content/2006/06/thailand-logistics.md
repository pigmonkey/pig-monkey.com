I'm hoping for ample internet access in Thailand via cheap internet cafes. In addition to hardening my local environment, I'll also be taking a few other precautions.

<ul>
<li>All posts made to the blog will be under a separate user account. This doesn't mean much to you, the loyal reader, but saves me from worrying if my password has been sniffed and someone is gaining admin rights to my wordpress install.</li>
<li>Though I hope to be checking my email, I <strong>will not</strong> be accessing my usual pm@ account. Instead, I've set up a separate email account:
vagabond at pig-monkey.com
This is so I don't have to worry about folks gaining access to my email. The <span class="removed_link">contact form</span> will not be updated to reflect this. So, again, the best way to get in touch with me is: <strong>vagabond at pig-monkey.com</strong></li>
<li>Photos will be securely placed in an undisclosed location, but the chances of me getting them somewhere web viewable while on the road is slim. As usual, I don't want to have to bother with sniffers and loggers.</li>
</ul>

I'm off tomorrow morning. Wish me luck with airport security and customs. And wish my backpack luck against the conveyor belts.
