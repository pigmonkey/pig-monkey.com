<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943382/" >Rudy Wurlitzer</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570621179/sr=8-1/qid=1149564765/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-8814873-3068035?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >Hard Travel to Sacred Places</a> takes us to the depths of depression caused by death, amplified by the depression of middle-class travel and expensive hotels in S.E. Asia. A kind of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but take out the drugs and toss in Buddhism. Although it's billed as travel writing, I found the actual locations and travelling to take a back seat to the author's attempt to reconcile the loss of his step-son with his spiritual beliefs. Indeed, if one were to take out all the Buddhist quotes, the book would probably be halved in length.
