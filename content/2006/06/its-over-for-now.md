Spring Quarter is over. And not a minute to soon.
I had stopped doing homework a few weeks ago. I wasn't motivated enough to do my final Computer Science project. While every one else crammed for finals, I immersed myself in the writings of primitivism, buddhism, and mayan myth.

I moved out of the dorms tonight and payed the holding fee for where I'll be living starting September. It's downtown, above the Pita Pit.

An email just arrived, confirming my reservations for my first three nights in Bangkok. <a href="http://www.suk11.com" >Suk</a> it, dorm style.
