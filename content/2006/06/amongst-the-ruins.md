<em>The following was written yesterday, 6-30, while I was exploring Ayuthaya.</em>

<strong>3:46PM</strong>
I managed to find a festival of some sort next to a bunch of ruins. There are many booths selling a variety of interesting things.

I had a meal of excellent chicken and rice. The lady gave me a few bags of sauce to put on it, and it was delicious. A-roi, as they say here.

They weren't kidding about the stray dogs around the city. There are packs of them all over. One followed me around the park for a while, so I gave him the left-overs of my meal. He had large wounds over his butt and hind legs. I don't know where he's wandered off to now.

People are giving out free samples. Lots of food. One lady put what looked to be hand lotion in my hand and motioned to put it in my hair, so I did. I didn't bring any shampoo on my trip, so whatever it was, it couldn't have hurt. I sure smell better, if a little feminine.

All over I get compliments on my hair. I don't think many Thais see guys with long hair. The lady at Baan Lotus tells me I'm beautiful.

It appears there's going to be some sort of performance. There's a stage where they've been playing what I think is a recorded speech and now there are people in costume looking like they're about to perform.

Speaking of people prancing around, lots are sucking some sort of orange liquid out of plastic bags. Maybe I should get one.

<strong>A few minutes later</strong>
I can't figure out where they're getting them from. I shall have to follow someone. Stalk them with my ninja ways.

On another note, Thais love their yellow golf-shirts. At first I thought it was some sort of uniform, but everybody and their mother (literally) has one.

<strong>5:00PM</strong>
On my way back to the Guest House I found what I think is the only sane motorcycle taxi in Thailand. At least, he didn't drive like he was in Grand Theft Auto (with God mode).

The lady who runs the house tells me she has day/night tours daily that leave at 4:40ish. Perhaps I'll do that tomorrow. I've had enough ruins for one day.

It dawned on me earlier today that I don't have to do the tourist thing. I had been thinking of heading to Chiang Mai tomorrow, but now I think I'll spend 2 nights here. Tomorrow I'll just hang around the peaceful guest house -- maybe looks at ruins, maybe not.

Perhaps I'll go back to the Muslim market I found today. They had really good food. One of the juiciest pineapples I've ever had.

The only complaint I can render of this place is that the walls are thin. There's little privacy, in the room or the bathroom.

Speaking of the bathroom...

There's a sign that says no toilet paper in the toilet, so, when in Asia...

I pressure washed my bum-crack. That was an interesting experience, but I'll spare you the details. Suffice it to say that I prefer moss as an alternative to toilet paper.

<strong>5:53PM</strong>
I jumped in the shower with all my clothes on. Hey, when you've got to do laundry...

The shower is not really a shower, just another hose in the corner of the bathroom. There's no curtain or anything, so everything gets soaked.

Little else is as relaxing as taking a cold shower and laying naked on the bed under the fan. I think I'll bust out my ipod and a book.
