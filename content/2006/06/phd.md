If there's one thing college has done for me, it's to reinforce the notion that a piece of paper with an accomplishment written on it means little. A title such as Dr. and a jumble of letters after someone's name is not, by any means, a measure of intelligence.

At the end of each term, we'd fill out evaluations for our classes and Professors -- but there was never a question as to if the Professor had a grasp of the subject they were lecturing on or not. Why is that?
Dangerous assumptions, says I.
