<em>The following was written yesterday, 6-30, upon my arrival in Ayathaya</em>

<strong>12:52PM</strong>
We ended up making lots of stops on the side of the road, dropping people off and picking them up. Every time, the guy in the yellow shirt would yell something I couldn't understand and I'd hope that it wasn't my stop. Though I suppose that wasn't really possible, since I didn't have a stop in mind. In the end, I just rode it to the end of the line.

As soon as I stepped off the bus, a tuk-tuk driver offered to take me to the ruins, but I pointed to the guest house in my Lonely Planet and said he could take me there instead. As usual, the 40 Baht he charged me was way too much, but I wasn't sure where the guest house was in relation to the bus stop, so I agreed. 20 Baht would have been better.

So now I'm sitting on my bed at the Baan Lotus Guest House. I had to leave my shoes outside. I hope it doesn't rain.

When I was taking my shoes off, a nice old woman came out to greet me. She was excited to see me, and said she only had 1 room left. It's got two beds in it, but she gave it to me for 300 Baht, which is pretty good. (Suk 11 charged me 250 for the dorm.) It's not as nice as the Suk, but I like it. No AC, but there's a fan and a good breeze coming through the windows.

I think I'll go down to check in and then figure out what I'm doing here.
