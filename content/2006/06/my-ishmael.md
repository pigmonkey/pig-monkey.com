Daniel Quinn's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553379658/sr=8-1/qid=1150845917/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-1848502-1587828?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >My Ishmael</a> stands above <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/06/11/ishmael/">the</a> <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/06/13/the-story-of-b/">others</a> as the superior book in the saga of the gorilla. Prior to this, Quinn was exploring the subjects with his narrators -- having some ideas down, but not quite sure where it would lead him. Here, he has obviously developed is ideas much further and is ready to lay forth practical challenges and solutions.
As usual, I highly recommend this book for its revolutionary potential and wonderful writing. Keep in mind that it should be read after Ishmael and The Story of B.
