<em>The following was written 6-27, while I was waiting at the gate at Sea-Tac</em>

Security was a breeze. I didn't beep going through the detector. No one checked my obviously military backpack or my obviously military daypack. Funny, that.

They're blasting CNN here at the gate. The news is kinda depressing.

By the way, when I was checking in they thought I was Pedro Honduras flying to Toronto. Oops. They found my my <span class="removed_link">Double Agent</span> identity.
