This is it, here it is. The book that pushes away all others as the most significant book of recent times. It's been a strong influence on me since before I heard it's name. Daniel Quinn's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553375407/sr=8-1/qid=1150078400/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0583809-1445456?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >Ishmael</a> is the originator of the primitive movement -- the so-called New Tribal Revolution. By allowing one to hear the myth that bombards us every day, Ishmael calls into question the basis of our society and forces one to look at the world in a different way.
There's little to say, other than read this book.
