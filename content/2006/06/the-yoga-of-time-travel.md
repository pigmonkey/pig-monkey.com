Fred Alan Wolf's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/083560828X/sr=8-1/qid=1150415767/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4371295-7885509?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >The Yoga of Time Travel: How the Mind Can Defeat Time</a> is, to put it lightly, a mindfuck. Using quantum physics as his base, he explains how one can travel through time. All it requires is ego-loss. (Someone's been reading Timothy Leary.)
It's an interesting book, but most of the physics went over my head.
