<a href="http://www.shadowcompanythemovie.com/" >Shadow Company</a> is the documentary on modern day mercenaries. Superior and more broad in its scope than <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/warriors/" >Frontline's Private Warriors</a> or <a href="http://iraqforsale.org/" >Iraq for Sale</a>, it essentially comes across as a film adaptation of <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/11/14/licensed-to-kill/">Licensed to Kill</a>, relying heavily on interviews with Robert Young Pelton, featuring video shot by RYP, and interviews with Cobus Claassens (the pirate hunting merc of <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/10/14/three-worlds-gone-mad/">Three Worlds Gone Mad</a>). It felt very balanced, allowing interviewees -- academics, reporters, and contractors -- to cast the industry in both positive and negative light. The underlying message seemed to be a call for regulation.
