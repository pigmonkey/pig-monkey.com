Today I took the Red Cross' CPR/AED for the Professional Rescuer course, upgrading my <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/08/02/m-for-medic/">previous CPR certification</a>. As before, it covered adult rescue breathing, choking remedies, and CPR, but this course went a bit more in depth into those subjects and added child and infant breathing and cpr, and the automated external defibrillator. We also got to use those fancy face masks, instead of the basic plastic barriers.

As the course title implies, it's intended for EMTs, nurses, SAR, LEO and the like. I think it's a course that folks would do well to attend if they're willing and able, but doesn't add enough on top of the basic CPR course to warrant taking otherwise. Basic CPR you should take, whether you want to or not.
