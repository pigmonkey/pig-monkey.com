Brigitte Mars' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Natural-First-Aid-Treatments-Preparedness/dp/1580171478/sr=8-1/qid=1165370021/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6940115-7868725?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Natural First Aid</a> is a nice little book for dealing with home, and some wilderness, ailments. The book begins with a short introduction to basic first aid -- CPR, splints, and the like -- and follows that with "An A-Z Guide to Ailments and Injuries," including everything from nosebleeds to jellyfish stings. Each ailment includes possible herbal and homeopathic techniques for prevention and remedy. The books also includes a chapter on "Surviving Nature's Challenges," which discusses basics of topics such as surviving bear attacks, making fire, and giving birth.

The book, sadly out of print, is very basic, and is no replacement for real first aid training, but certainly warrants a spot on your bookshelf for herbal reference.
