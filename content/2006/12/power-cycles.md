The wind was strong enough yesterday to cause power outages and cycles throughout town. When I got home, I discovered that whoever I'm borrowing my wifi from had lost his internet connection. I waited a few hours, waiting for him to do something about it, but nothing happened. Finally I fired up telnet and rebooted his AP/modem for him, which reconnected everything.

Don't you appreciate neighbors like me?
