<a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/10/11/always-have-a-camera-ready/">Once</a> <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/11/20/it-seems-to-be-a-trend/">again</a>, I was awoken by a disturbance on the street. This time it was about 2:15AM. They were right below my window, so it was a bit hard to see what was going on. The fight looked to be between two girls, with about 10 male onlookers cheering and exclaiming the occasional "oh damn!" (Girl fights always look particularly brutal -- no mercy.) As far as I could see, there were no cops or cameras. After a couple minutes, the group migrated around the corner. I drifted back to sleep to a soundtrack of "the bitch attacked me!"
