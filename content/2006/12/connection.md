According to <a href="http://weblife.org/honey.html" >Shaie's Honey article on WebLife.org</a>,
<blockquote>...if a person has allergies to the natural environment they are in (grass, trees, ect...) if they take a spoon of honey everyday (honey from same region) it will gradually reduce their allergic reactions.</blockquote>

So <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/11/30/acclimatize/" >turn off your processed air</a>, eat local, and re-realize your connection to the environment.

Live in it. Accept. It's part of you, and you it.
