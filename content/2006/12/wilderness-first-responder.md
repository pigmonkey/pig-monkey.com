Tomorrow is day one of my <a href="http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wildfirstresponder.shtml" >Wilderness First Responder</a> course, the next step up from the Wilderness First Aid course I took last year.

> Essential for anyone who spends significant time in remote places or who has a professional career in the outdoors, the Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course will prepare you to make difficult medical decisions. This course is fast-paced and engaging. You'll spend half your time outside of the classroom doing hands-on skills and realistic scenarios. In addition to scenarios, you'll participate in a full-scale night mock rescue. WMI's curriculum encompasses a wide range of topics including long-term patient care, wound management, straightening angulated fractures, reducing dislocations, litter packaging and administering medications. You'll complete this course with the tools and confidence to manage patients in the backcountry for multiple days. The intensive 80-hour curriculum is nationally recognized and supported by the Wilderness Medicine Institute's Medical Advisory Panel. You'll be taught by dynamic educators who have practiced both wilderness and urban medicine. This 10-day course is ideal for all professionals operating in remote environments.  Adult CPR certification is included. The WFR course is pre-approved for 70 hours of EMT CEU's by CECBEMS.

8am-5pm for 10 consecutive days. Oughta be fun, as long as they provide nap time.
