For the past couple weeks I've been listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000034CLD/sr=8-1/qid=1147631614/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2120913-2071949?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >Didgeridoo Dreaming: Aboriginal Spiritual Music</a>. It's an excellent two-disc set of didgeridoo, clapping sticks, and chanting. I think it's much more conductive to inducing trance than any modern electronic music I've heard, even Shpongle.

(And the guy on the cover is hardcore.)
