Last night was my first time <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/14/nightwalking/" >NightWalking</a> since the Redwoods. It seemed much darker than it ever was in California and I was afraid I'd fall off the ridge I was walking on, but, as always, my feet found the path.

It really does work.
