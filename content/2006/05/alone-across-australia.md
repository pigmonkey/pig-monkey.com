Tonight I went to a showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428215/" >Alone Across Australia</a>, a film about Jon Muir (no, not <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/" >that one</a>) and Seraphine, his dog, who walked across the continent of Australia. Seraphine was killed by a dingo somewhere around day 110, but Jon made it in 128 days. 4 months later he walked to the North Pole.

It was sort of a <a href="http://www.lesstroudonline.com/" >Les Stroud</a> meets <a href="http://goliath.mail2web.com/default.asp" >Karl Bushby</a> thing. I highly recommend it.
