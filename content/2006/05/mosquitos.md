One can always depend upon Tamarack Song to have a different -- dare I say hollistic? -- view of things. Over at <a href="http://www.natureskills.com/index.html" >Nature Skills</a>, he has an <a href="http://natureskills.com/mosquito_bite_prevention.html" >article on Mosquito Bite Prevention</a>. Some of his more interesting advise is thus:
<ul>
<li>Don't smell funny and they won't bite you. Avoid perfumes, "smell like you belong". (Eat garlic to mask your breath.)</li>
<li>Don't look like a clown and they won't be attracted to you. Natural, earth hue colors help you to blend in.</li>
<li>Bask on oil. Mosquitos don't like to get their wings greasy.</li>
<li>Enjoy a breeze. Mosquitos can only fly 8mph.</li>
</ul>
