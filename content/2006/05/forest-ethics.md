I went to a presentation by <a href="http://www.forestethics.org/" >Forest Ethics</a> about the <span class="removed_link">Inland Temperate Rainforest</span> (the only one in the world) today. It's a pretty amazing region, in some ways like the Amazon, but is being destroyed by clearcutting. Forest Ethics puts pressure on logging companies by annoying people like Victoria's Secret (who put out 1,000,000 million catalogs a day) and hardware stores to stop doing business with loggers who operate in the region.

For those interested in training and discussion in more direct action, and aren't afraid of the FBI, <a href="http://www.forestdefenders.org/" >Forest Defenders</a> is hosting a Cascadia Action Camp this weekend and <a href="http://wildearth.resist.ca/" >Wild Earth</a> is a 4 day conference happening this June in B.C.
