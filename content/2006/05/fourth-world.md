I just got back from hearing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Churchill" >Ward Churchill</a> (who's a registered Republican) speak. He was amazing. The lecture wasn't really on anything in particular -- he went all over the place. He doesn't use notes, powerpoint, any of that, but you can really feel the passion in him. He shakes, cries, laughs, everything.

He also invited one his friends from the audience, a member of the Black Panther party, to come up and speak for a bit. Among a few other things, he described the morning he was walking around the sand-bagged Seattle Panther office with a riot shotgun and got the call that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton" >Fred Hampton</a> had been assassinated. Not something you hear everyday...

Churchill is going to be speaking again tomorrow morning on a panel. If I wake up early enough (doubtful), I'll go.

Oh, and he's even larger in person.
