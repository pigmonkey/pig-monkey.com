An obvious follow up to <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/05/26/the-worlds-most-dangerous-places/">DP</a>, today I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581603819/sr=8-3/qid=1148852456/ref=pd_bbs_3/002-6899363-9141642?%5Fencoding=UTF8" >Adventure Travel in the Third World : Everything You Need To Know To Survive in Remote and Hostile Destinations</a> by <a href="http://www.jungletraining.com/" >Jeff Randall</a> and Mike Perrin. Unlike <em>DP</em>, I'm not a big fan of this book. Though I did learn some things in the wilderness survival and first-aid sections, the book is written rather poorly and the travel advice is, I think, common sense.

It's not necessarily a bad book, and I certainly respect the authors for their experience and knowledge, but I don't recommend it.
