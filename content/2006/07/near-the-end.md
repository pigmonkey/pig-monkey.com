<em>The following was written 7-17, waiting for the bus in Phitsanulok</em>

<strong>8:23AM</strong>
I would like, sometime, to fill in the pieces. To record the events for myself and others. So much has happened on this trip, this journal representing only a very small part.

More so, I would like to write some sort of conclusion. Here, near the end of, I look back at all the people, bus rides, and blisters, and they all meant something. After all, they happened, didn't they?
