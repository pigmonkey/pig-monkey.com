I walked to the halo Buddha's Wat a little bit ago. It was much closer than the map made it appear. It is, I think, the most impressive Buddha I have yet to see.

Afterwards I stopped by an internet cafe I had seen while walking to the Wat. I'm hear now, in the loud room, on a computer that is getting constant pop-ups and virus warnings. A far cry from the Debian machine I had last night.

Speakeasy claims I'm getting 774k down and 364k up, but it feels much slower.

I'm almost out of time, but not looking forward to leaving the AC.
