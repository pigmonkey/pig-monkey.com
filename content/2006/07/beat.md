<em>The following was written 7-13, in a windowless room in Chiang Mai.</em>

<strong>8:54PM</strong>
Back in Chiang Mai.

The bus ride over played Tears of the Sun. Bruce Willis shouldn't be dubbed in Thai. It doesn't work.

I must be staying in the Italian quarter of town. Pizza and other Italian restaurants abound. I found a tasty one for lunch. Homemade ice cream, too.

Even in Thailand, I'm told I look like a pirate...

Today marks day 1 of 7 that I must take Malarone out of the malaria zone.

Found another used book store and traded <ul>Shopping for Buddhas</ul> for Ginsberg.
