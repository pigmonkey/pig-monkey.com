<strong>7:46AM</strong>
The sky opened up, thunder roared and lightning flashed last night, just as I had reached the safety of the floating restaurant. The storm kept me pinned on the boat for a couple of hours, but eventually died down enough for me to make a run for it without getting too wet. I made for a spot a few blocks away where earlier I had seen tuk-tuks waiting. Sure enough, one was there, and he overcharged me (as usual) for a ride back to the guest house.

I'm sitting in a cafe now, with my pack. Breakfast is a banana smoothie and waffle -- though waffles here are always considered more of a dessert.

One night in Chiang Rai, there was a street vendor selling waffles. Plain -- no syrup, toppings of any sort -- but were they ever good. One of the best, I'd say. These aren't that great. Taste more like microwaved Ego, really.

There are two little girls here in uniform, looking like they're waiting to go to school. They're both watching the Disney Channel, the commercials on which are in English, but Goofy, Mickey, and even Donald are dubbed in Thai. (I didn't think Donald spoke even English.)
