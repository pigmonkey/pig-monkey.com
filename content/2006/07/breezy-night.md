<em>The following was written 7-8, during my first night in Pai.</em>

<strong>9:01PM</strong>
I took dinner at Amido's Pizza Garden across the river. At almost $4, it's the most expensive meal I've had yet, but tasty, and the town deserves my Baht.

(You'll notice I've been avoiding Thai food since being sick. I don't think that the food had much to do with it, but still...)

Amido couldn't do enough to tell you how great Santana is.

<em>"He want make guitar talk to you, he make guitar talk to you. He want guitar cry, he make guitar cry."</em>

The breeze off the meandering river makes the nights cools here, but also welcomes mosquitoes. A couple big ones kept bugging me at dinner.

I broke my own rule and neglected to put socks on before heading out tonight. I think I've survived so far with no new bites, though.

Took another Malarone with dinner.
