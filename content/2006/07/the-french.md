Before I left for Thailand, I heard from a few people that, by the end of their trips, the Thai language got to annoy them -- it's so tonal and can sound very much like whining. That hasn't happened to me.

But the French!

I've discovered that if you see another white person in Thailand, there's something like a 97% chance that they're French. As such, you hear the language all the time around guest houses and the tourist strips. I have no idea why, but it's really begun to annoy me.

And it's nothing else about the people. Sure, they're a quirky bunch, with their attention to manners and being so proper, but it's only the language that has grown to annoy me.

Nothing against the French. Only an observation.
