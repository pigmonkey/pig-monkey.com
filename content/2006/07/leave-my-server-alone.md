I've been hosting a dvd rip <a href="http://www.loosechange911.com/" >Loose Change: Second Edition</a> for a few months. It recently found its way onto a couple divx crawler sites, which managed to sexually violate my bandwidth.

On 7-21, it got 495 hits.
On 7-22, it got 12,369 hits.
On 7-23, it got 5,295 hits.

Luckily, not all of those people downloaded the whole thing, but it still used 495357.72MB in those three days. So the file has been removed for now. It'll be back up in a month, when the new billing cycle starts.

At least I know the automatic site throttling works.
