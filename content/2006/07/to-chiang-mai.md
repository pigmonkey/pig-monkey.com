<em>The following was written 7-1 in Ayudaya</em>

<strong>3:32PM</strong>
The lady who runs the guest house has a van that goes to Kanchanaburi tomorrow. She tried to sell me on that, but I told her I was thinking of going to Chiang Mai. A few minutes later, she came up to my room and said that because it was the weekend (I hadn't realized), I might not get a train ticket. She gave me a time table and said that if I wanted, she would send "the boy" to go buy a ticket for me. So, he's off buying me a 2nd class ticket for the 9:52AM train to Chiang Mai. It arrives about 8:00PM.
