Speakeasy tells me I'm getting 232k down and 194k up. Slow, but this is one of the nicer cafes I've been in. Cheap, too.

I don't know what I'll do the rest of the day. Probably just read a book.

Looks like <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003110069_criticalmass07m.html">trouble at Critical Mass</a>. The Seattle ride rarely makes news.

And a new Patrolling has been released! That will have to wait till I get back.
