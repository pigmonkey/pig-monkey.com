<em>The following was written 7-19, in Terminal 2 of Don Muang, Bangkok.</em>

<strong>12:50AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>
Arrived at the airport and it seems every airline's check-in booth is open, but United. I'm told they open at 3:30AM. There's a waiting area here, so I've sat down with my pack. The airport is by no means empty, but is very calm. A strange state for an airport.

Kofi Annan on CNN.

<strong>1:09AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>
Just made a collect call home. Apparently Microsoft called me a few days ago for a game test.

<strong>1:15AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>
You know, I've been trying to follow this whole Israel-Palestine-Lebanon thing briefly when I get online, and I really don't understand how anyone can be on Israel's side.

I watched the first bit of Bush's press conference in Germany where he said something like the "terrorists" are trying to "halt Israel's pursuit of peace." That's about as crazy as saying that the US is pursuing peace -- perhaps worse.

I read a few days ago that Kofi wanted a peace keeping force to go to Lebanon and stop them from attacking Israel, to give Israel an excuse to stop attacking Lebanon. How can he say that? If you want to occupy someone, occupy Israel. Give Hezbollah an excuse to stop attacking them.

Look at the numbers. There's been, what, 14 Israelis killed? And how many hundreds of Lebanon folks (Lebanonese? Something like that)? Maybe Israel just has better bomb shelters or bigger boom sticks, but, regardless the reason, they are undeniably the more dangerous, terrorizing player.

Hell, the guest house I checked out of this morning has a sign on the front desk proclaiming they don't accept Israelis because they've had too much trouble with them stealing. They're terrorizing folks even here in Thailand.

But that was uncalled for. I'm attacking the Israeli government, not the people. And I doubt there are many Lebanon tourists here, so it isn't a fair comparison.

Though while I'm on the subject of Israel, I'd like to say that they need to stop that compulsory military service thing. It blurs the line between government and civilian, and allows Israel's enemies to justify killing of civilians.

<strong>4:06AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>
I'm at my gate now. The flight boards at 6:05AM, so I've about 2 hours.

Security actually acted like they care this time. They searched my checked backpack by hand, with machine, and even confiscated the waterproof matches I always carry with my first aid kit.

Those things cost like $5...

My money belt beeped going through the detector. It was just the zipper -- she didn't care to even unzip and look inside. I have my credit card in there, and could very easily have one of those credit card knives, too.

While they were searching my pack, I was asked if security could ask me some questions. I said yes (did I have a choice?), but then was only asked the usual "did you pack your bag", "has it always been with you", etc. I thought they were going to take me aside and poke something up my anus. Oh well. Maybe US will want to do that.

<strong>4:24AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>
I should mention that on my way to Bangkok, I put my backpack in 2 of the heaviest-duty trash bags I could find, in hopes of protecting it from the airport conveyor belts. It came out fine.

This time, I sent it through naked. I have no doubt that the bag itself will make it -- it is, after all, military grade -- but am curious as to the fate of the straps. This is a good chance to test it, since I don't care so much about it going home. If it gets destroyed, I pick up another on ebay for $35.

<strong>5:39AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>
There's a group of about 20 American kids here in bright green shirts. Look like high school. Their 2 chaperons are sitting next to me. I wonder who they are. From what I've overhead, they're going to Chicago.

They're being annoyingly loud.

The United folks are setting up for body searches, so perhaps I'll be randomly selected after all.
