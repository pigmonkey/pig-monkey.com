Slug: 1200-meters

<em>The following was written 7-4 in a hill tribe village, somewhere in Northern Thailand.</em>

<strong>5:36PM</strong>
We climbed 1200 meters, almost straight up, during the hottest part of the day, in about 1.5-2 hours. It was hell. Within about 15 minutes I was dizzy and all my limbs were trembling.

It wasn't the actual walk that got to me -- my legs weren't tired at all -- but the heat. And dehydration.

It was worth it though, for the view. Rolling green hills wherever you look. We've been lounging around the village here for the past 2 hours. About 150 live here. All the buildings are bamboo. And on stilts.

I'm told dinner is elephant trunk. I think he's joking.

There are dogs and chickens all over the village. The people grow corn to sell and rice to eat.
