The ice cream was bad. My stomach regrets it. They call themselves America's Favorite Ice Cream Parlor, too. I've never even heard of the guys before today...

I'm in a funky little internet cafe across the street now. They have tasty looking smoothies -- I should have come here before the ice cream place and gotten one of those instead.

Somebody is taking a bunch of pictures of the place. Maybe I'll end up in an ad somewhere.

Speakeasy says 612k down, 515k up.

I was exploring Chiang Rai earlier. Found the night market, but they were just setting up, so I wandered down here to kill a little time.

I've been online a lot lately. Updating daily, it seems.
