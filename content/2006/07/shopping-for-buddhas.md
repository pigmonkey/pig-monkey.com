<em>The following was written 7-9 in Pai.</em>

<strong>4:36PM</strong>
I should leave Pai before I run out of books.

I've just now finished Jeff Greenwald's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/086442471X/sr=8-1/qid=1152523819/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1503616-5534537?ie=UTF8">Shopping for Buddhas</a>, which I picked up at Hobo Books in Chiang Mai. It documents the author's time spent in Nepal, searching for the perfect Buddha statue who's purchase would lead to enlightenment.

I enjoyed the book -- sort of a <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/06/05/hard-travel-to-sacred-places/">Hard Travel to Sacred Places</a> trip. Very humorous at times, and offering up ironic spiritual journeys at others. It is an accurate description of travel throughout Asia.
