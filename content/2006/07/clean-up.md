I went to one of the smaller beaches in the area today. Smoke beckoned me till I found a good size fire that someone had left blazing. It took me a while, but I was able to get all the flaming wood and coals into the water and clean the pit (it hadn't burned deep). It's annoying that someone would leave something that large still burning. There was a smaller fire nearby, but that one had burned out. They had carved in a log "In 2006 we smoked weed here".
