<em>The following was written 7-14, in the attic of an old lady in Sukhothai</em>

<strong>8:30PM</strong>
The bus left Chiang Mai at noon and arrived upon Sukhothai at 5:30PM. From the station, I caught a tuk-tuk to the Baan Thai Guest House. They were full, but I was told there would be a room for me tomorrow night and another solution for tonight. A home stay, she said.

And so tonight I bed down in the attic of an old lady (she must be 80) who speaks no English. The bed is quite hard, but will do.

Tomorrow I will leave the room to the spiders.
