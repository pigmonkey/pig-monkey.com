<strong>5:52PM</strong>
I've finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803261705/sr=8-2/qid=1153044222/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-1701346-5466559?ie=UTF8">Black Elk Speaks</a>, as told through John Neihardt by Nicholas Black Elk, which I also purchased in Chiang Mai. I enjoyed the book as a history of the Lakota people and an insight into Native American spirituality, through the eyes of a Shaman and Warrior. It's strange that a book written in 1931 can seem so new, even today.

What struck me most was Black Elk's vivid memory of his past. He's able to recount so many details, and has so many tales to tell. Yet after his people are slaughtered at Wounded Knee, he has nothing else to say. As if living the way of the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wasichu">Wasichus</a> ended his life -- all a downward spiral of no significance from there on.
