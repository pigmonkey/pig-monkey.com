<em>The following was written 7-15, in Sukhothai Historical Park</em>

<strong>11:30AM</strong>
Fruitless, here in the shadow of ruins. Man's labor, great civilization reclaimed by nature.

Crumbled stone returning to the womb of the Earth to become life once again.

Why keep playing?

The river is change, but endless. Coming and going.

Spirits returning to shadow, and the darkness engulfing all.

Only questions.

Looking and searching and grasping.
