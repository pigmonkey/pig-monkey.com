<blockquote>Beloved friends and accomplices,

The Infernal Noise Brigade has died young. Come and celebrate its
pretty corpse.

Former Infernalistas the world over are en route to Seattle to swell
the band's ranks into a giant, implosive force before leaping into the
grave. Join us for one last march (7/28) and a massive all-night
funeral wake (7/29)--at which the Infernal Noise Brigade will, though
technically dead, perform two final sets before descending into hell
for their rewards, either in the seventh ring (for violence to the
possessions of the capitalist state) or the ninth ring (for treachery
against Homeland Security).
