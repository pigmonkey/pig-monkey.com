<em>The following was written 7-17, in Bangkok</em>

<strong>6:05PM</strong>
The train came in at around 3PM. From the station I caught a motorcycle to the Barn Thai Guest house. That's the last time I do that with my backpack -- I about fell off the back of the motorcycle from the weight of the pack every time he accelerated.

We drove around for a good hour trying to find the place. Nobody who the driver stopped to ask had heard of it, until we found one guy who told us it exploded. At least that's what I gathered from the broken English and sign language.

Boom.

So I chose another, but they were full. The third choice worked out, but they stuck me with a hidden "key deposit" fee of 200 Baht after I'd checked in.

Ah, Bangkok.

They're playing Pirates 2 across the street on a couple of plasma screens. Not a cheap cam or anything, either. How long has that been out? It must have been since I left. Explains all the "you look like a pirate" comments I've been getting.

I'm only about a 5 minute walk from Khao San, so I explored that a bit today. Where else can you sit on the sidewalk, getting your hair dreaded, while listening to 50 Cent blast from a bar across the street?

It's not as bad as it's made out to be, really, but I'm glad I avoided it before. The whole district is getting on my nerves actually. Next time I'll go back to the Suk 11.

I might go back to Khao San tomorrow and buy a fake press ID. They're cheap, and you never know when that could come in handy.

The guest house looks to have a bag storage service. It's 30 Baht, instead of the free I'm used to (everything is much more expensive here in Bangkok), but it'd be nice to not have to carry my pack around all day. I figure I could pick it up and head to the airport around midnight.

My Baht was running low when I arrived today. I probably could make it through with what I had, but decided to exchange a little more. I'm not running low on dollars, but trying to hang on to what I have so I don't have a bunch to exchange on the other end.

I can't wait to get out of Bangkok, though I'm not looking forward to the long plane ride, either. Wish I could go back North. Chiang Mai is about as much city as I can handle.

<strong>6:54PM</strong>
Day 5 of 7 for Malarone.
