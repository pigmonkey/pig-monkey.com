Last night I went to a showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395796/" >Trudell</a>, a film about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Trudell" >John Trudell</a>, the Native American poet/activist. He lead the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island for 21 months, and, following that, was the National Spokesman of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movement" >American Indian Movement</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movement#The_Pine_Ridge_incidents" >Pine Ridge Shootout</a>. After burning an American flag on the steps of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, his pregnant wife, three children, and mother in law were burned alive in a suspicious arson fire. In the words of the FBI "He's extremely eloquent... therefore extremely dangerous."
Speaking of the FBI: he's said to have one of the longest FBI files in history, at over 17,000 pages.

His music is interesting -- it's spoken word poetry set to traditional Native American music, with a little blues guitar thrown in for good measure.

He'll be here speaking today, but I can't go, as the pre-trip meeting for this weekend's snowcamping trip is at the same time.
