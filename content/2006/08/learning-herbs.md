<a href="http://learningherbs.com/" >LearningHerbs.com</a> is run by John Gallagher, one of the creator's of <span class="removed_link">Wilderness Awareness School's Kamana program</span>. The site offers a <a href="http://www.learningherbs.com/herbal_kit.html" >DIY kit</a> that caught my eye a while ago, but I only recently decided to order. It came last Wednesday.

Included are the instructions and ingredients to make an echinacea <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tincture" >tincture</a> and an herbal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salve" >salve</a>. It's amazing how simple both are to create, and they both provide a great confidence boost for an herbal noob like myself.

The salve I've been using for about a week as a lip balm and on itchy bug bites. It works great for both. I was only able to get my hands on some vodka a couple days ago, so the tincture still has another 6 weeks to sit before I can report back on that.

For anyone interested in herbs, I definitely recommend forking over $50 for the kit. I love it. It also includes access to a 7-day online course, that I've yet to begin, but plan to when the time is right.
