I went to <a href="http://boomkak.com/bakerblues/main.html" >Baker Blues festival</a> yesterday. My third or fourth year, I think. They moved to a new location this year, and amped the whole thing up to three days.

Music this year eclipsed the past. Chris Duarte? The closest thing living to a Hendrix or Vaughan today.

My arms are burnt to a crisp.
