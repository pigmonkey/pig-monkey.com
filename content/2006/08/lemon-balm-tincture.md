I've an abundance of dried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_balm" >Lemon Balm</a> hanging around, so last night I decided to tincture 2/3 of it. Trouble is, none of my books contained alcohol percentages or ratios for the herb. Google seemed to think that 100 proof alcohol would be fine, but couldn't come to a conclusion as to the ratio. Some sites said 1:1, some 1:4, and still others claimed 1:5.

The most important part of tincturing, I've been taught, is that the herb is completely covered for the first two weeks. I made my measurements to use the 1:5 ratio, but, to cover everything, ended up with a mixture closer to 1:16. Let's hope it turns out.

In one and a half moon cycles, it will be ready for use -- calming nervous systems, fighting fever, helping digestion, and even combating herpes (hey, you never know).
