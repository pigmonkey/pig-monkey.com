<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0936756926/sr=8-1/qid=1156356486/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4854229-4306429?ie=UTF8" >Gone to Croatan: Origins of North American Dropout Culture</a> is an alternative American history. It is a collection of essays, poems, and art, documenting America's lost drop-outs, rebels, and other undesirables. The majority deal with the revolutionary period.

The book has its ups and downs. Some pieces are crafted in such a way that I only skimmed through them, others enthralled me. I recommend it for fans of Hakim Bey.
