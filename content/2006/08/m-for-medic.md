Today was my Red Cross CPR and First Aid class. The 2 hours spent on first aid were a joke. Compared to that, Wilderness First Aid might as well be an EMT course. We just watched a video for the different illnesses and wounds covered, and the solution for all of them was "dial 911".

The CPR portion of the 9AM-4PM class, on the other hand, was great. I learned a lot -- not surprising, as I didn't know anything about it going in -- and might even remember a thing or two.

I recommend signing up for the CPR class. The instruction was good, the classmates fun. (Speaking of which, I was the only one taking the course for fun. All else were required by work or school.)

So now I am certified by the Wilderness Medicine Institute in Wilderness First Aid, the American Red Cross in Standard First Aid, and the American Red Cross in Adult CPR. This winter I plan to take the week long Wilderness First Responder course. Look out <a href="http://coachb.net/images/medic.jpg" >medics</a>.
