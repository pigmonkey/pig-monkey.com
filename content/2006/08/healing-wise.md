<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961462027/sr=8-2/qid=1155875314/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-3740855-1223265?ie=UTF8" >Wise Woman Herbal: Healing Wise</a> is an excellent book written by Susun Weed, one of those shifty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianic_Wicca" >feminist witches</a>. She begins the book with an examination of what she sees as the three different healing methods: the scientific method (who's motto is "your body is a machine, you broke it, and now must be punished" and who's symbol is a line), the heroic method (who's motto is "you broke the rules and must suffer the consequences, repent" and who's symbol is a circle), and the wise woman method (who's motto is "accept the illness and learn what good it has to offer" and who's symbol is a spiral).

After analyzes the three methods and their healing practices in depth, she moves on to describing 7 herbs -- common weeds that can be found in the crack of any sidewalk, in any city -- but she doesn't just devote a page or two to each. Instead, each "green ally" receives special devotion in its own chapter, and she introduces and teaches about them in wonderfully unique ways.

Obviously the book is written from the female perspective, for the female, but, as a male, I didn't find that hindered the book for me in any way. (Though it does show how even the most seemingly free-thinking people can be boxed in by our culture and it's duality, but that's <span class="removed_link">another</span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit" >discussion</a>).

I highly recommend the book for everyone. Even if you have little interest in herbs or healing, this is a book to have on your shelve for battling the common cold. No <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/04/AR2005110402200.html" >id check</a> required.
