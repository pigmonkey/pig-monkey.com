Gregory Tilford's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0878423729/sr=8-1/qid=1155596889/ref=sr_1_1/104-4806664-0249569?ie=UTF8" >From Earth to Herbalist</a>, which I purchased with my <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/08/03/learning-herbs/">herbal kit</a>, is an herbal field guide that "challenges us to reconsider our roles as herbalists, to go beyond health care consultant, medicine-maker, wildcrafter, and gardener/farmer to become earth-steward". It combines the two roles of field guide and medical resource in one book that has managed to show me a new, "earth-conscious" way of looking at plants.

Reading it at MutantFest, all I had to do was simply adjust my gaze in order to locate most of the plants mentioned in the book. A great learning experience.

I recommend the book for anyone interested in herbal medicine.
