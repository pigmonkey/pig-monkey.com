Robert Young Pelton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385495668/sr=8-1/qid=1155579826/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4806664-0249569?ie=UTF8" >Come Back Alive</a> is a pun on survival guides. At least, that's what I thought when I picked it up. As it turns out, the books makes fun of most other survival guides, but takes itself seriously -- slightly disturbing, as most of his advice is questionable. It focuses on urban survival (driving, crime, etc) and, of course, war zones, forsaking wilderness survival for another time (or perhaps I just glazed over the wilderness sections, knowing they wouldn't hold much of value).

It's written in the same dark humor found in <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/05/26/the-worlds-most-dangerous-places/">DP</a>, so I would recommend it for fans of RYP, but only as entertainment.
