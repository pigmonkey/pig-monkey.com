<a href="http://clamormagazine.org/blog/archives/fall-issue-sneak-preview/" >According to Clamor</a>, <a href="http://americanapparel.net/" >American Apparel</a> has prevented their workers attempts to unionize and the company's founder has had three different sexual harassment charges filed against him by workers. (Article preview <span class="removed_link">here</span>) So, there'll be no more purchasing of their products by me. I recommend <a href="http://nosweatapparel.com/" >No Sweat</a>.

Sadly, this also means I can't buy from <a href="http://proletarianthreads.com/tshirts/index.html" >Proletarian Threads</a> anymore (they print on American Apparel shirts).
