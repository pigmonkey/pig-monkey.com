Today I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609610554/sr=8-2/qid=1156102890/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-9945940-3840823?ie=UTF8" >The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill</a>, a book about the author's time with a flock of wild parrots in San Francisco. The book has its ups and downs, becoming boring at times with the attention payed to the parrots' every action, but, overall, it's a good read.
