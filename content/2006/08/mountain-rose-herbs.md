I was linked to <a href="http://mountainroseherbs.com/" >Mountain Rose Herbs</a> through <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/08/03/learning-herbs/">LearningHerbs.com</a>. They are a "global provider of bulk organic herbs, spices, teas, essential oils and other herbal miscellany," and have become my standard herb provider.

In my order was their Tea Sampler, which includes the following:
<blockquote><strong>Dream Tea</strong>

And I purchased a bag of 21st Century Tea:
<blockquote>There are so many ways that our immune systems can be overwhelmed ... air, water, workplace, stress etc. This infusion blend is not only helpful, but comforting, strengthening and delicious. Contains: Red clover blossoms*, nettle* leaves, pau d'arco, alfalfa* and sage* leaves, St. John's wort* herb and a hint of ginger* root.

I love all the teas. They're all, without doubt, the best tasting I've had.

I also picked up some dried Lemon Balm for <a href="http://www.learningherbs.com/herbal_branch_24.html" >ice tea</a> and a little powdered goldenseal root.
