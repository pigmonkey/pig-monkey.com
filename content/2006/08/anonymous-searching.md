<a href="http://www.scroogle.org/" >Scroogle</a> is a nice tool. No cookies, no logs, no worries concerning <span class="removed_link">leaks</span>. But is it too much to ask for a stylesheet? Google presents results in such a clean, organized way. Scroogle is just ugly.

The majority of my searching I do via Google, accessing it only through Tor and denying it cookies. This is undoubtedly an anonymous way to search, but is ruined by Google's attempt to please. Because of my shifting IP, I rarely every reach Google.com, but am instead redirected to Google.de, Google.fr, Google.it, or some other. Without cookies, the "Google.com in English" button does nothing.

Results tend to be the same, and in English, with the exception of other language sites receiving higher placement than they would on Google.com, but I can't use the spell-check feature, the dictionary feature, or any of those other little conveniences.

Anyone have any suggestions for another search method?
