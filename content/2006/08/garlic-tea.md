There's a lot of garlic around here not doing anything, so today I decided to make a tea, using <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/139436" >this recipe</a> as a base. It claims:
<blockquote>In Mexico, or Spain for that matter, garlic tea is served up for coughs or colds. People swear by it! The garlic oils inhibit cough and cold microbes, and they are effective decongestants. Lemon juice reduces and thins mucus, which makes it easier to unclog a stuffed up respiratory system. Lemon juice also changes the body's pH, making it less hospitable to viruses and bacteria.</blockquote>

I altered the recipe a little bit to fit the ingredients I had laying around, and the tea turned out great. A bit too much honey for my taste, but other than that, great. 16oz of the stuff is sitting in the fridge for me to try chilled tomorrow.

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>3 cups waters</li>
	<li>5 whole garlic cloves</li>
	<li>3oz fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
	<li>As much Italian honey as is left in the jar
		<ul>
		<li>The stuff was practically solid, not that cheap liquid honey you get at the supermarket. Were I to toss it into a measuring cup, I'd guess it would report about 4oz</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>2 pinches of Lemon Balm</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Bring 3 cups water and garlic cloves to a boil</li>
	<li>When boiling, turn down heat and add lemon juice, honey, and Lemon Balm</li>
	<li>Return water to boil for 30 seconds or so, allowing chunky honey to liquefy</li>
	<li>Strain, serve, enjoy</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Now if only I was sick, I could report back the medical benefits.

<strong>Update:</strong> That stuff went right through me. Perhaps it cleans the kidneys?

<strong>Second Update:</strong> It's tasty cold, though the honey all sunk to the bottom.
