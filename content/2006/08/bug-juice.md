MutantFest served as my testing ground for <a href="http://goodnaturedearthling.com/catalog.htm?item=20&ret=http://goodnaturedearthling.com%2Fcatalog.htm%3Fpage%3D1%26keyword%3Dbug" >Good Natured Earthling's bug spray</a>, made by my soap teacher. I was surprised how well it worked. During my whole time in the Forest, I was bit only once, and that was before I broke out the bug juice in the evening.

I highly recommend picking up a bottle.
