Michael Maren's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Hell-Ravaging-Effects-International/dp/0743227867/sr=1-1/qid=1162668291/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3983907-1016609?ie=UTF8&s=books" >The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity</a> shatters the glossy image of NGOs as humanitarian organizations concerned with the betterment of third-world peoples. Instead, he claims Aid as a new kind of colonization. Focusing on Somalia, Maren shows that NGOs there not only didn't help refugees, but actively killed them. That NGOs supported the power of Siyaad Barre and, later, Mohamed Farah Aydiid. And that NGOs were largely responsible for continuing and worsening famine conditions in the early '90's. In the end, he shows them as no more than Corporations concerned with profit.

It's an excellent book. Not only for exposing the Aid industry, but for the history and understanding of Somalia.
