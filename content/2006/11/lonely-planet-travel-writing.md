It was recommended to me last summer that I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Travel-Writing-General-Reference/dp/0864427425/sr=8-1/qid=1162953415/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6326810-2241503?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Lonely Planet's Travel Writing</a>. I expected the book to be about the art, but instead it focused more on the details of how one enters the travel writing and scene and how to get published -- something I have little interest in. If you're serious about making travel writing a profession, particularly if you're interested in writing for guide books, then this may be a worthwhile read. For the rest of us... just write.
