Title: Snow and Cold

The temperature was about 60&deg;F when I left NYC yesterday. I'm told it normally hovers around freezing this time of year.

My flight landed to find snow on the ground, and the temperature in the mid-30&deg;s -- a good 10&deg;-20&deg; colder than usual. It rarely snows here.

What's with that?

My train home was delayed about an hour. The power switches weren't working, so the crew was forced to manually switch. The old fashion way. We pulled in at about 10:30PM.

It was 31&deg;F, with a foot of snow. My walk home was doubled in length.

Now it's 15&deg;F outside and a bit warmer inside. The sidewalks and roads have been cleared, exposing thick ice underneath.
