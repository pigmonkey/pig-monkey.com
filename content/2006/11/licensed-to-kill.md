Robert Young Pelton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Licensed-Kill-Hired-Guns-Terror/dp/1400097819/sr=8-1/qid=1163536487/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0629414-4993616?ie=UTF8&s=books" >Licensed to Kill</a> is the definitive post-9/11 book on guns-for-hire. From Baghdad's Route Irish to the Afghan/Pakistan border, RYP is able to enter the closed world of mercenaries, PMC/PSC, and other contractors in a way that <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/scholars/fellows/psinger.htm" >academics</a> and <a href="http://iraqforsale.org/" >reporters</a> cannot.

In a world where <span class="removed_link">Blackwater is deputized</span>, this seems an important book for all. Like the guns they wield, mercenaries can be used for good or evil.

(Those interested in the EO/Sandline mercs of the '90's would do well to add <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/10/14/three-worlds-gone-mad/" >Three Worlds Gone Mad</a> to their reading list.)
