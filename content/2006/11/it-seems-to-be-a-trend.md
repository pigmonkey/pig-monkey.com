I was awoken at 3:54AM last Sunday by <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/10/11/always-have-a-camera-ready">another</a> ruckus out my window. A group of perhaps 6 college kids were walking down my street, being followed by a middle-aged man, screaming variations of "He threw jam in my face!" and "I'm not the mother fucker to fuck with!"

It appeared he was angry with only one of the kids, and that unlucky fellow was there with only one other. The rest seemed un/lucky bystanders. The friend of the target was walking to his car and began to unlock it when the middle-aged man threw one, maybe two, punches in the face of the jam-thrower. The old man was promptly shoved away while the two friends got into the car. They sat there for a couple minutes, I assume dialing 911, while the old guy beat the car with his bag and continued yelling.

By this time, three of the onlookers were taking pictures and video, and another was on her phone. (One girl forgot to disable her flash. I wondered if she was <a href="http://www.dtdistributors.com/fox.html" >packing</a>.) The angry guy started to walk away, and the rest of the kids jumped into the waiting car to drive away, except the girl on the cellphone who yelled at them to wait for 911.

The only somewhat related police report is this:
<blockquote> Reported: Nov 19 2006 3:58AM
Offense: MALICIOUS MISCHIEF
Case #: 06B49724

(A1) was cited for malicious mischief for smashing the window of a vehicle.

Arrested: BROWN, MARK ALBERT Age: 40 (DOB: Feb 27 1966 )</blockquote>
I imagine he could have busted a window of the car while hitting his bag against it, though I think the assault part would be slightly higher charges. I went back to sleep before the police arrived.
