I learned of her thanks to [Bruce Sterling](/2019/01/sterling/)'s mention in his [2020 State of the World](https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/507/State-of-the-World-2020-Bruce-St-page01.html), wherein he defines her music one of the few current examples of "genuine technical novelty".

She [used machine learning to train a program](https://www.thefader.com/2019/05/21/holly-herndon-proto-ai-spawn-interview) (referring to it as "AI" seems popular but I'll refrain) that could reproduce human voices, and then used that software as a vocalist for [PROTO](https://hollyherndon.bandcamp.com/album/proto). Neat.
