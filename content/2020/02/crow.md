[Crow](http://asthecrowflies.org/) is a woman who spent the summers hiking (mostly all or part of the PCT) and the winters as a cabin hermit (mostly in north-central Washington). Her interests in long-distance travel and off-grid living share many commonalities and resulted in much valuable [information](http://asthecrowflies.org/2007/12/14/illustration-of-personal-philosophy-on-keeping-people-from-bothering-you/) and [insight](http://asthecrowflies.org/2009/11/22/advice-for-hermits/). Long time readers here will remember her from [The Vagabond's Spatula](/2010/09/the-vagabonds-spatula/).
