In 2014 [I identified the ASP Defender series as the best pepper spray for my needs](/2014/11/oc/). I stand by this today, except that originally my preference was for the 4.5" [Palm Defender](https://www.asp-usa.com/collections/personal-safety/products/palm-compact-defender). Over the years my preference has migrated to the 5.75" [Key Defender](https://www.asp-usa.com/collections/personal-safety/products/key-medium-defender). The Key Defender is in my pocket every day.

While I prefer pocket-carry for everyday, I've often thought about something that would allow for quicker access -- especially on the bike. I've looked at a number of solutions for mounting a capsicum delivery mechanism to a bike, but never found one I liked. Instead, I ended up purchasing a second ASP Key Defender and mounting it to the shoulder strap of my backpack, which I wear frequently when in the saddle.

A small split ring connects the Defender to a [magnetic clasp](https://www.amazon.com/Lixada-Magnetic-Release-Fishing-Connector/dp/B0719Q6LZJ/). This in turn is attached to a [Lucky Line Flex-o-loc](https://luckyline.com/products/flex-o-loc/) (the same thing I've been using on [my keychain](/2013/08/keychain/) for seven years), which connects the whole setup to the webbing on my shoulder strap. To prevent the Defender from swinging around, I attach an [IWB Soft Loop](https://www.shopdiyholster.com/iwb-soft-loop-black-sold-individually/) around the shoulder strap and shove the Defender through that.

The Soft Loop holds the Defender tight enough against the strap that it doesn't spin around during daily carry. When mounting the Defender, I orientate it so that safety clasp (which I still cover with grip tape) is against the shoulder strap. This eliminates any chance of the safety somehow accidentally becoming released and the trigger actuating. It also keeps the safety in a known, consistent position when the Defender is drawn.

Enough of the shaft of the Defender is left below the Soft Loop that it can be easily gripped. It is deployed by simply ripping downward. The magnetic clasp breaks away and the top of the device slides through the Soft Loop. This is very quick and very easy to do, with either hand, even when wearing gloves.

Another neat benefit to the magnetic clasp is that it allows you to easily reattach the Defender, if you decide you quickly want both hands free. The magnet is strong enough that it will connect if you simply wave the top of the Defender within a couple inches of the half of the clasp still attached to the shoulder strap. This can be done without looking. Of course, the Defender will swing around as you move until you shove it back underneath the Soft Loop -- a procedure which does take two hands and at least one eye.

I'm happy with this setup as a supplement to the OC carried in my pocket. It can move easily to different backpacks. It could probably be made to work with any pepper spray intended to be attached to a keychain, though it works especially well with the ASP Defender series thanks to the hammer grip used to deploy them.
