The use of respirator masks in popular culture is often [more about social signaling than medical efficacy](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/coronavirus-mask/), similar perhaps to [decorating your door frame with lamb's blood](https://www.biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm). Yet [huge global demand](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/business/coronavirus-face-masks.html) has [caused a shortage in hospitals](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/health/hospitals-coronavirus.html), where the use of respirators does actually serve a functional purpose. A Vietnamese company -- possibly realizing that much of the current demand stems from symbolic usage -- decided to [make masks out of toilet paper](https://www.insider.com/vietnam-company-using-toilet-paper-for-coronavirus-masks-faces-penalty-2020-2). These would have sold well in Hong Kong during the [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) epidemic, where [mask usage emerged as an important social ritual](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444305012.ch8):

> In a masked city it was difficult to recognize the identity even of one's friends and colleagues as they passed. Yet mask-wearing became the quickly improvised, if obligatory, social ritual; failing to don one was met with righteous indignation, a clear sign of ritual violation. The mask symbolized a rule of conduct -â€“ namely, an obligation to protect the wider community -- and an expectation regarding how one was to be treated by others (Goffman 1967b [1956], p. 49). More simply, the mask was the emblematic means by which people communicated their responsibilities to the social group of which they were members. Through mimicry and synchronization... mask-wearing amounted to a joint action, normatively embodied, the entrainment and attunement of the society as a whole. By disguising an individual's face, it gave greater salience to collective identity. By blurring social distinctions, it produced social resemblance. Mask-wearing activated and reactivated a sense of a common fate; it was a mode of reciprocity under conditions that supremely tested it. Accordingly, mask demeanor was much more than a prophylactic against disease. It showed deference to public emotions and the decision to respect them.

Today mask usage [interferes with facial recognition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/frustration-grows-china-face-masks-184312468.html). That AI researchers and corporations are [scrambling to work around this limitation](https://www.abacusnews.com/tech/wearing-mask-wont-stop-facial-recognition-anymore/article/3051388) is expected, but in a sane timeline individuals would identify this limitation as an unexpected bonus of the ritual. Instead the response is [printing faces](https://faceidmasks.com/).
