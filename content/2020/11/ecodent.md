Title: On Toothpowder

After posting about my [toothpaste capsules](/2019/06/toothpaste-capsule/) last year, [Ze Stuart](https://zulusierra.co/) wrote to ask if I had ever considered toothpowder. He recommended [Eco-Dent DailyCare](https://www.eco-dent.com/dailycare-toothpowders).

I had not brushed with a commercial toothpowder product before, though had tried carrying baking soda on some backpacking trips for this application. I was never happy with the result. Mostly I think it was just that the lack of foaming and mint flavor, both of which I've been psychologically conditioned to associate with "clean".

Eco-Dent was available locally, so I bought a bottle and started using it. Application is easy: wet the brush, squirt out a bit of the powder from the bottle's flip top lid, and brush like normal. After brushing for a second the powder froths up, and the experience is more or less the same as brushing with toothpaste.

The label claims that the 2 oz bottle can provide "up to 200 brushings", which I find to be inaccurate. My first bottle lasted me 350 days. I brush twice a day, so that is 700 brushings. That works out to be about $0.01 per use, which is better than any toothpaste can offer. (Perhaps they expect you to use more of the powder per brushing than I do, but I always use enough to generate the same frothy lather I'd expect from toothpaste.)

When travelling, I repackage the powder into a [0.25 oz bottle](https://www.litesmith.com/cylinder-bottles-ldpe/). That is plenty for a week or two, takes up no space in a toiletry kit, and weighs approximately nothing.

There are plenty of other toothpowders on the market, but I've bought another couple bottles of Eco-Dent. Between those, my [collection of toothbrush heads](/2020/01/toothbrush-maintenance/), and a stash of floss, I'll be out of the dental care market for a few years.
