The same [spray bottle of isopropyl alcohol used to clean my human interface devices](/2020/01/hid-cleaning/) is also used to clean the [brake pads](http://www.koolstop.com/english/dura2.html) and braking surface on my bike.

Soap, degreasers, and similar cleaners are best avoided on these components. They can leave residue that decrease braking performance and causes squealing (thus diminishing the all important [bike ninja](http://yehudamoon.com/comic/2008-01-25/) factor). Spraying the brake pad with isopropyl alcohol and wiping it off with a clean rag is usually all that's needed. Sometimes I'll hit the pads with a [Scotch-Brite Scour Pad](https://www.scotch-brite.com/3M/en_US/scotch-brite/tools/~/Scotch-Brite-Heavy-Duty-Scour-Pad/?N=4337+3294529207+3294631680&rt=rud) after spraying them.

The braking surface on the rims is cleaned the same way: spray with alcohol, wipe with rag. Occasionally, if the wheels are especially dirty, I will break out the big guns in the form of [my all-purpose cleaner](/2019/07/cleaner/). Before spraying the rim with this I remove the wheel from the bike because I don't want to get the cleaner on my brake pads. After spraying the rim with the cleaner, I wipe it down with a clean rag. Finally any residue from the cleaner needs to be removed, which is accomplished by spraying the rim with isopropyl alcohol, and wiping it down again. Sometimes it takes a second cycle of alcohol-and-wipe to eliminate squealing.
