A [Cleaveland Mountaineering Fork Clamp Mount](https://cleavelandmountaineering.com/product/fork-clamp-mount/) allows me to mount a [King Cage](http://kingcage.com/) to my old [Tubus Vega](https://www.tubus.com/en/products/rear-carriers/tubus-product/vega-classic/) rack, providing another option for carrying water. I've wanted something like this since I saw [Logan's Vega modification on bikepacking.com](https://bikepacking.com/gear/tubus-vega-surly-ecr-rack-mods-extra-h20/). Cleaveland's mounts makes it easy.

I use [Norma Torro Worm Drive Hose Clamps](https://www.normagroup.com/norma/en/products/norma-torro/) to attach the mount. These German made clamps are far superior to the Chinese hose clamps frequently found in hardware stores. The 9mm wide, 8-16mm diameter clamps are the right size for this job.
