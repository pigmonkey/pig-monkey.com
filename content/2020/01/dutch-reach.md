Title: The Dutch Reach

When opening the door of a vehicle with your closest arm -- the left arm when exiting on the left side of the vehicle, for instance -- your body is positioned straight ahead. A turn of the neck is required to see the side mirror, and a twist of the body is required to clear the blindspots of the mirror. Both of these movements require explicit motivation. With the [dutch reach](https://www.dutchreach.org/), you reach across your body with the opposite arm -- your right arm when exiting on the left side of the vehicle. This forces your body to twist. You are automatically positioned to see the side mirror, and only a slight twist of the neck is required to clear the mirror's blindspots.

The dutch reach is marketed as part of bicycle safety. As a biker I appreciate this, but I think this is only a small component of the method. It is about situational awareness. Sitting in [a parked car is a vulnerable position](https://www.activeresponsetraining.net/ambush-prevention-strategies-for-patrol-officers) -- [exiting more so](https://www.activeresponsetraining.net/the-dangers-of-transitional-areas). It is rational to want to know what you are about to step into when exiting.

Perhaps rebranding it as "tactical vehicle egress" would promote wider adoption.
