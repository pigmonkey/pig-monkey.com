Title: Wired is running an editorial arguing that the 10,000-year clock is a waste of time (get it?).

The thrust of [the article](https://www.wired.com/story/the-10000-year-clock-is-a-waste-of-time/) seems to be that the world sucks today, and that building a monument to inspire long-term thinking is a waste of resources -- "a pleasant distraction" -- since everybody alive today will be dead before any good comes of it. Which, I don't know, seems like it's sort of the point.

There's plenty to criticize about [The Long Now](http://longnow.org/) -- I swing by [The Interval](https://theinterval.org/) once a year or so, always hoping that it will have become an interesting place to spend time and always leaving disappointed -- but I don't think the idea of [the clock](http://longnow.org/clock/) is one of them. The rate of progress on the clock(s) is another matter.

The article, however, reminded me of the idea of *protopia*, a neologism [first coined by Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/protopia/) and lately [championed -- in a slightly different manner -- by Monika Bielskyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZLLW2y4eo).
