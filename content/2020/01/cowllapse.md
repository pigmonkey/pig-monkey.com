[The Guardian reports on the end of food](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet) and the cowllapse:

> We are on the cusp of the biggest economic transformation, of any kind, for 200 years. While arguments rage about plant- versus meat-based diets, new technologies will soon make them irrelevant. Before long, most of our food will come neither from animals nor plants, but from unicellular life. After 12,000 years of feeding humankind, all farming except fruit and veg production is likely to be replaced by ferming: brewing microbes through precision fermentation. This means multiplying particular micro-organisms, to produce particular products, in factories.
> 
> [RethinkX envisages](https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture) an extremely rapid "death spiral" in the livestock industry. Only a few components, such as the milk proteins casein and whey, need to be produced through fermentation for profit margins across an entire sector to collapse. Dairy farming in the United States, it claims, will be "all but bankrupt by 2030". It believes that the American beef industryâ€™s revenues will fall by 90% by 2035.
