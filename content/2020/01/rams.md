In 2018 I went to the [San Francisco premier](https://www.hustwit.com/events/sf-rams) of [Rams](https://www.hustwit.com/rams/) at [The Castro Theatre](http://castrotheatre.com/).

I'd previously seen [the](https://www.hustwit.com/helvetica) [other](https://www.hustwit.com/objectified) [documentaries](https://www.hustwit.com/urbanized) made by [Gary Hustwist](https://www.hustwit.com/about), but had not found them to be especially relevant to my interests. Rams, however, I greatly enjoyed. On the whole I think that German industrial design is best industrial design, both functionally and aesthetically. I was familiar with many of the designs of [Deiter Rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) that the documentary highlights, but seeing all the objects together in Rams' home -- not as a museum display, but as practical tools for living -- really drives home his skill and vision.

I'd been wanting to watch the film again for a while. Last month I decided to [purchase it on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/ramsfilm/). I'd never done this before, and was nervous of the experience. Vimeo claims to provide a DRM-free download, but I was concerned that their definition of "download" may be different from mine, or that they would attempt to serve it through some some platform-specific crapware. Fortunately this was not the case. After completing the purchase, it was simple to navigate to the download link, which was a straightforward URL to a DRM-free 1920x1080 MP4 file. Purchasing and downloading the video on Vimeo was just as simple as purchasing and downloading music on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), which is the standard against which I judge all other digital media distributors (it is a low bar, but many seem to fail).
