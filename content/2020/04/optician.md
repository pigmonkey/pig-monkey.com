Title: I published my script for creating optical backups.

[Optician](https://github.com/pigmonkey/optician) archives a directory, optionally encrypts it, records the integrity of all the things, and burns it to disc. I created it last year after writing about the steps I took to create [optical backups of financial archives](/2019/06/optical-financal-backups/). Since then I've used it to create my monthly password database backups, yearly e-book library backups, and this year's annual financial backup.
