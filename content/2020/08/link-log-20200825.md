[Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/)

> COVID-19 has reawakened America's spirit of misdirected anxiety, inspiring businesses and families to obsess over risk-reduction rituals that make us feel safer but don’t actually do much to reduce risk-even as more dangerous activities are still allowed. This is hygiene theater.

[Elderblog Sutra: 11](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/07/30/elderblog-sutra-11/)

> Applied to a blog, angkorwatification is a sort of textual equivalent of rewilding. You have a base layer of traditional blog posts that is essentially complete in the sense of having created, over time, an idea space with a clear identity, and a more or less deliberately conceived architecture to it. And you have a secondary organic growth layer that is patiently but relentlessly rewilding the first, inorganic one. That second layer also emerges from the mind of the blogger of course, but does so via surrender to brain entropy rather than via writerly intentions disciplining the flow of words. I've seen some other old sites undergo angkorwatification. Some seem to happily surrender to it like I am doing, others seem to fight it, like I won’t.

[Bikes of the Bunch: Rob English's English road bike](https://cyclingtips.com/2020/08/bikes-of-the-bunch-rob-englishs-english-road-bike/)

> I am very excited about this revolutionary bicycle, and look forward to testing it. Look at all the gains -- the same braking power, modulation and control, but with less weight, easier-to-remove wheels, no hydraulics, more compliant fork and no rotor-rubbing noises! Yes, there are a couple of downsides -- it's not ideal in the wet, and it can't use the best shaped aerodynamic (carbon) rims. Still, could this oversized rotor concept be the next big thing in cycling?
