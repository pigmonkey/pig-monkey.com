Title: Pandemic Omega

So far my only recent purchase directly related to pandemic is another bottle of Omega-3 supplements.

A few years ago I accidentally [discovered that Omega-3 supplements are an effective remedy for the cracked skin I experience on my hands due to dry winter air](/2018/12/omega/). Usually I pop my last pills sometime in February and don't bother re-upping until the following November. This year I ran out in December and didn't experience any issues -- it must have been a more humid winter than usual -- so I didn't restock. But toward the end of February my hands were starting to feel dry due to the increased frequency of [hand washing](/media/images/hand-washing-litany.svg), use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and surface cleaning.

I restocked the pills, started dosing twice a day, and about a week later the skin on my hands felt healthy and smooth. I can wash my hands as frequently as I want, with whatever soap is available, and not worry about my skin cracking and creating a new vector for attack. The skin suit is fully operational.

Purchasing another bottle of Omega-3 supplements seems a much more rational purchasing response to COVID-19 than the newly popular pass time of nonsensical hoarding of bottled water and toilet paper.
