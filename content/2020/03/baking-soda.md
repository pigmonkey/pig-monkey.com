I use it to occasionally supplement [my all-purpose cleaner](/2019/07/cleaner/) when [washing dishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G0LjVIh7_Y), use it to [clean produce](/2019/07/produce-wash/), and sometimes dump some in with [my laundry](/2018/12/laundry-alternative/).

I store baking soda by the kitchen sink in a [Progressive Prepworks Mini Prokeeper](https://progressiveintl.com/products/mini-prokeeper). This had a good, tight seal that keeps the baking soda fresh and dry, and has a little dusting insert for easy shaking. The 1.5 cup capacity is meant to hold the contents of a standard sized cardboard box of baking soda, but I don't buy those.

For the past three years I have purchased [13.5 pound resealable bags of baking soda](https://www.armandhammer.com/baking-soda/baking-soda-products/pool/baking-soda-resealable-bag-135-lb). I bought my first bag in January 2018 and found it lasted me exactly one year. I have purchased another bag each subsequent January. The bags are cheap (I pay an average of $8) and keep the bulk baking soda fresh and dry for the year. I fill the Prokeeper container from this, and otherwise keep the bag sealed.
