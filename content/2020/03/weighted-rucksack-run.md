Title: It's been a while since I've regularly run with a weighted rucksack.

In the past two weeks I've been getting back into the practice. To setup the bag, I remove the [Control Panel 1](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/control-panel-1/) and [Transport Sleeve](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/transport-sleeve/) that I normally EDC in my [FAST Pack Litespeed](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/fast-pack-litespeed/) and replace them with an internally mounted [Transporter Tail](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/fast-transporter-tail/). This is used to secure a [30 lb Hyperwear Steelbell](https://hyperwear.com/product/steelbell/). On the outside of the bag the only change I make from my normal setup is the addition of a prototype [FAST Stability Belt](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/fast-stability-belt/). With the bag weighted down I [lash on my sandals](/2019/03/cairn-slippage/), fire up my [antisocial activity tracker](/2015/08/gpx/), and it's almost like [it's 2011 again](/2011/04/rucksack-run/).
