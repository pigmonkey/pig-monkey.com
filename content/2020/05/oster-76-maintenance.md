Title: Oster Classic 76 Maintenance

Last year I [mentioned my happiness with the Oster Classic 76 clippers](/2019/06/oster-76/). One of the attributes I called out was its serviceability. Today, after five years of personal use, I decided it was time to remove the faceplate, clean the innards, and replace the grease. I followed the instructions in [Oster's maintenance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zErMj5c1G74) (which appears to be straight out of 1998). It's a simple process. I only cut my hair once every 4-8 weeks, so I suspect performing the deep cleaning every five years is about the right schedule. I lubricate the blade every 3 or 4 uses.

No special tools were needed. Something pokey and scrapey is helpful for cleaning out the small crevices. I used a titanium [Norton Universal Cleaning Stick](https://countycomm.com/products/nortons-u-c-s-universal-cleaning-stick) because I had it close to hand, but a flathead screwdriver would work just as well. All parts appear to be in excellent condition, and when reassembled the clippers pur like an angry kitten.
