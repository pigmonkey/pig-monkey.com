Title: I've started mounting my bike lights via shock cord.

The [previously mentioned](/2019/11/cozycaps/) [Orfos Pro](https://www.orfos.us/pages/pro) LED flares ship with [Velcro One-Wrap](https://www.velcro.com/products/ties-and-straps/900604__one-wrap-rolls/) for mounting. This works well enough, but lately I've decided I prefer using [shock cord](https://milspecmonkey.com/store/hardware-diy/347-shock-cord.html) and [cord locks](https://milspecmonkey.com/store/hardware-diy/128-itw-gtsp-cordlock.html). The cordlocks add a little weight to the system, but this setup mounts to all the things I want to mount the lights to, and makes it very easy to tighten. After tightening the lights don't move around at all, where with the Velcro they would move a little on a bumpy road. This system is also quick to attach and detach, which I appreciate when parking, and can be more easily manipulated when wearing [full-fingered gloves](/2018/05/alpha-gloves/).
