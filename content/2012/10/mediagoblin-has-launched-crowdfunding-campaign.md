I've been following the development of [MediaGoblin](http://mediagoblin.org/) and [OpenPhoto](http://theopenphotoproject.org/) for about a year. Both offer decentralized and federalized photo sharing services, and promise to be excellent solutions for when [Flickr finally dies](http://gizmodo.com/5910223/how-yahoo-killed-flickr-and-lost-the-internet). OpenPhoto currently feels more mature, but MediaGoblin is more ambitious in scope. I hope to see both of them succeed. Today, [MediaGoblin announced a crowdfunding campaign](http://mediagoblin.org/news/crowdfunding-campaign-launches.html) to fund development. I'll be [donating](http://mediagoblin.org/pages/campaign.html).
