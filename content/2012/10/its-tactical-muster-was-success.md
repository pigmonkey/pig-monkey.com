The [inaugural event](http://www.itstactical.com/centcom/its-information/inaugural-its-tactical-muster-details-and-packing-list/) made me proud to be part of [ITS](http://www.itstactical.com/). I enjoyed meeting a part of the community around the site, and it was an honor to be included among the high caliber instructors.
