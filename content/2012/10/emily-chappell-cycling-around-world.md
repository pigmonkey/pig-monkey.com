She quit her job as a London bike messenger and left the UK in September of 2011. Currently she is in Korea, having cycled across Eurasia. I was made aware of [her blog](http://thatemilychappell.com/) a couple months ago and was immediately hooked. I went back to [the very beginning](http://thatemilychappell.com/2010/11/hello-cruel-world/) and read the blog all the way through. There are not very many blogs out there that I can say *that* about.
