I'm no [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) evangelist. I have my reservations about the currency. But one common critique that consistently angers me is that [bitcoins are not secure](http://www.economist.com/node/21563752?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/monetaristsanonymous) because there have been [instances of theft](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3642/what-are-the-most-notable-cases-of-coins-or-wallet-thefts/3719#3719). This is equivalent to claiming that Federal Reserve Notes are insecure because people get mugged. Secure your shit.
