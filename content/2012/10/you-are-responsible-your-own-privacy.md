Every so often there are stories announcing the fact that [emails are not legally protected](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/reading-someones-gmail-doesnt-violate-federal-statute-court-finds/) or that [G-men can access email older than 180 days without a warrant](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/04/fourth-amendment-email-2/). There will be some minor uproar, complaining about how outdated the law is, but here's the thing: it's irrelevant.

You don't need to trust your service provider. You don't need to trust your storage provider. You don't need the law to protect you. You simply need to take a little self-responsibility and encrypt your data.

Any private data stored on hardware that you do not physically control should be encrypted (and it's a good idea to encrypt private data on hardware that you do physically control). Problem solved. [Unless you're in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000).
