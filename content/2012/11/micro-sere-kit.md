As I [mentioned previously](/2012/10/inaugural-its-tactical-muster/), there was quite a lot of swag given out to attendees of the [ITS Tactical](http://www.itstactical.com/) Muster. My favorite piece was the Micro SERE Kit put together by [SerePick](http://www.serepick.com/) and [Triple Aught Design](http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/).

Matt from SerePick donated a set of [Bogota entry tools](http://www.itstactical.com/skillcom/lock-picking/serepick-bogota-entry-toolset-review/)<strike>, a diamond wire blade, a folding tool that includes a saw and razor, a small button compass, two universal handcuff keys, two handcuff shims, a small ceramic razor blade, Kevlar cord, and steel wire</strike>. *[The additional items were purchased by ITS for the kits, not donated by SerePick.]* TAD Gear (who also provided two students, in the form of Brett, their CEO, and Anthony, their Art Director) added to this kit their brass [Survival Spark](http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Equipment/Tools/Survival-Spark) and four Tinder-Quick tabs.

TAD also developed a custom pouch to hold this kit. It's similar to a bicycle tool roll, but on a smaller scale. The closure strap allows the pouch to be mounted to any webbing, whether it be a belt or PALS. I think it would be great to see this become a regular product, perhaps co-branded between TAD, ITS and SerePick, but for now the pouches are exclusive to alumni of the ITS Muster.
