I began to read [his blog](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/) last summer, when he was riding from Anchorage down along the continental divide. It's a great blog, and his gear is clearly heavily used and carefully chosen. Recently, he has discussed his [cook kit](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/kit-list-food-and-drink/), [tools](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/kit-list-tools-and-repairs/), [luggage](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/kit-list-luggage/), [clothing](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/kit-list-clothing/), [electronics](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/kit-list-electronics-and-paper/), and his [bike](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/kit-list-the-surly-pugsley/) and [the changes](https://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/pugsmorphology/) it has gone through.
