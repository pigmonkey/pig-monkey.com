Terence Eden [points out](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/smuggling-usb-sticks/) that censorship becomes more difficult as flash memory devices become smaller and gain greater capacity. Case in point: Director [Jafar Panahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jafar_Panahi) smuggled [This Is Not a Film](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1667905/) out of Iran [on a flash-drive hidden in a cake](http://manila-bulletin.net/blog/2011/11/05/film-smuggled-in-usb-up-for-screening-at-13th-cinemanila/). For me, the practicality of the [sneakernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet) became revitalized after I began using [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/) earlier this year.
