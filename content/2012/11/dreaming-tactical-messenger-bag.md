I wish someone would make a tactical messenger bag.

Plenty of companies make what they claim to be a tactical messenger bag: [5.11](http://www.511tactical.com/All-Products/Bags-Backpacks/Business-Tactical/Rush-Delivery-Messenger-Bag.html), [Spec-Ops](http://www.specopsbrand.com/tactical-gear/packs/t-h-e-messenger-bag-regular.html), [ITS](http://www.itstactical.com/store/discreet-messenger-bag-gen-2/), [TAD](http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Equipment/Bags-And-Packs/Dispatch-Bag), and [Maxpedition](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/GLENEAGLE-MESSENGER-BAG-Large-p1233.htm) to name a few. None of these fit the bill. Those bags are all what I would refer to as a side bag or a man-purse. I don't use that term in a derogatory sense -- they're fine bags, but they're not messenger bags.

For me, the defining characteristic of a messenger bag is that it designed to be worn on the back, not hanging down on one's side. [Timbuk2](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/), [Chrome](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/), [Seagull](http://www.seagullbags.com/), and [R.E.Load](http://reloadbags.gostorego.com/) are examples of companies that make messenger bags. I want one of those bags, but with the excellent, so-called "tactical" features that the aforementioned companies bring to the market: appropriate use of PALS webbing<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:pals"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:pals" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>, ability to support concealed carry, a quick-access medical compartment<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:medical"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:medical" title="see footnote">2</a></sup>. (Oh, and velcro for my tacticool patches, of course.)

Try riding a bike with a tactical man-purse, and then try riding a bike with a messenger bag. It's easy to see why anyone with "messenger" in their job title carries an actual messenger bag. The practicality of such a bag isn't limited to just the bicycle market: try running, or performing any physical activity (particularly a violent one, as might be required by someone with "tactical" in their job title) with a bag flapping on your side. It doesn't work. Some companies have tried to address this by [adding a stabilizing strap](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/catalog/9831K7_detail.jpg) to help lock the bag in place. That's a fine addition, but it is no replacement for a bag that is properly designed in the first place.

I can't recognize any advantages that the man-purse offers over the messenger bag. The messenger bag, on the other hand, offers distinct advantages over the man-purse.

Everyone and their mother makes an admin panel. Just give me some PALS and allow me to mount to the admin panel of my choice to the bag.</li>

Now just think how much more likely an armed biker is to need something of that sort!</li>
