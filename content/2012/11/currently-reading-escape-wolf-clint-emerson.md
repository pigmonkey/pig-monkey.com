[The book](http://www.amazon.com/Escape-Wolf-Security-Traveling-Professionals/dp/1598589679) is in a similar vein as Gavin de Becker's [The Gift Of Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_of_Fear) (a book I strongly recommend), but with more acronyms and typos. [Clint Emerson](http://www.escapethewolf.com/) focuses on external awareness more than the internal awareness discussed by de Becker. There are some good tidbits in it, but overall I would award the book a "meh" rating.
