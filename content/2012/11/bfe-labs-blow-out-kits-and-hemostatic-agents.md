Their videos on [blow-out kit basics](http://bfelabs.com/2012/10/28/blowout-kit-basics-a-preface-to-hemostatic-agents/) and [hemostatics](http://bfelabs.com/2012/10/28/hemostatic-agents-myths-lies-facts-applications/) are worth a view. [BFE Labs](http://bfelabs.com/) is not updated frequently, but the blog remains one of my favorites for practical skill and tool discussion.
