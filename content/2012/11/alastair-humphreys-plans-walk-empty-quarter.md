[Wilfred Thesiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Thesiger) is one my heroes. [Arabian Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_sands) is one of the great travel books (and one of the few to survive the repeated purges of my bookshelf). Now [Alastair Humphreys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Humphreys) and [Leon McCarron](http://www.leonmccarron.com/) are [planning their own walk](http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/adventures/emptyquarter/) through the [Empty Quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali). I'm excited to see what comes of it.
