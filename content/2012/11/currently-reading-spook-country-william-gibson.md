[Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson) was one of the most influential authors of my childhood. I had not kept up with him in this millennium, but have begun to rectify that by reading [Pattern Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_(novel)) a while ago and now [Spook Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country).
