Over at [Cold Thistle](http://coldthistle.blogspot.com/) Dane muses on the [appropriate use of a belay jacket](http://coldthistle.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-belay-jacket-tutorial.html). At [Cascade Climbers](http://cascadeclimbers.com/) he has an article [reviewing various synthetic puffy jackets](http://cascadeclimbers.com/synthetic-insulated-jacket-layering-review-by-dane-burns/). (I've been using the [Rab Xenon](http://us.rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/synthetic-fill/xenon-jacket.html) for over a year now and am very fond if it -- although the [Hill People Gear Mountain Serape](http://www.hillpeoplegear.com/Products/tabid/762/categoryid/11/Default.aspx), which I purchased last December, has replaced the Xenon in some settings.)
