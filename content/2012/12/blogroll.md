The blogroll is a standard feature of most blogs that is conspicuously absent from the current version of this website. In the past I've struggled to keep my blogroll up-to-date. In order to be useful, I think the blogroll should contain only blogs that I am currently reading. That list fluctuates frequently, and I have a poor track record of keeping my blogroll in sync with [my feed reader](https://www.newsblur.com/). One of the problems is that I regularly read many blogs, but there are very few blogs out there whose every post I enjoy.

But [I use microblogging to share links](https://pig-monkey.com/2012/11/23/leaving-twitter-behind/). So, why not just continue with that method? When I created [the latest version](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/09/15/mark-two/) of this blog I decided to do away with the blogroll entirely. Now, when I read a blog post that I particularly enjoy, I blog about it. Like [here](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/11/1/bfe-labs-blow-out-kits-and-hemostatic-agents/) or [here](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/12/13/puffy-layers/). When I come across a blog that is full of wonderful posts, I [blog about it too](http://pig-monkey.com/2012/10/4/emily-chappell-cycling-around-world/) -- and, chances are, I'll still end up blogging about individual articles on those websites. All of these microposts are assigned the [blogroll tag](http://pig-monkey.com/tags/blogroll/).



To me this seems like a much more meaningful way to share links. Rather than maintaining a separate page with a list of not-frequently updated links, you have the [blogroll tag archive](http://pig-monkey.com/tags/blogroll/). Links are timestamped and curated, which makes it more useful to my readers. And I think that linking to specific content rather than full domains makes for a more useful and rewarding metric for the owners of the linked blogs.
