Statistically, 38&deg; is the "oh-my-god-we're-all-gonna-die slope". An inclinometer is a useful tool to carry to help evaluate the potential of a particular slope. There's no replacing hands-on training, but Bruce Temper's [Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594850844) is an excellent resource for learning more than you want to know about avalanches. (If you live in the northwest, you should give money to the [Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center](http://www.nwac.us/). They do good work.)
