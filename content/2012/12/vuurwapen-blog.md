Title: Vuurwapen Blog is one of the only firearm-centric blogs that I subscribe to.

Andrew's [reviews and analysis](http://vuurwapenblog.com/) are intelligent and refreshingly concise, particularly when [some people](https://www.youtube.com/user/nutnfancy) feel the need to put out 45-minute videos in order to communicate 3 minutes of content. Unfortunately [Vuurwapen Blog will no longer concern guns](http://vuurwapenblog.com/2012/11/30/vuurwapen-blog-is-no-longer-about-guns/). Fortunately, Andrew will be writing about firearms at [LuckyGunner Labs](http://www.luckygunner.com/labs/) and Vuurwapen will still be around to focus on other topics.
