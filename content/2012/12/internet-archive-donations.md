They are trying to purchase another [petabox](http://archive.org/web/petabox.php) (that's [ one quadrillion bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte)). Donations are being matched 3-for-1 till the end of the year, so now is a good time to [give them money](https://archive.org/donate/) and support digital archiving.
