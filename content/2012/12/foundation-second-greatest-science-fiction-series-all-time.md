(The greatest, of course, is [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)).) In 1973, the BBC recorded an [8-episode radio series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Trilogy_(BBC_Radio)) of [Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)'s [Foundation Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series). The show is now in the public domain and available for [download at the Internet Archive](http://archive.org/details/IsaacAsimov-TheFoundationTrilogy). It's well done. When I read Foundation I failed to continue past the original trilogy into the later work. This show has encouraged me to revisit the books.
