When [the book](http://www.amazon.com/This-Machine-Kills-Secrets-WikiLeakers/dp/0525953205) was first published I assumed it would be just another entry into the media hubbub around [WikiLeaks](http://wikileaks.org/). When I saw that [John Young](http://cryptome.org/) -- cranky old man of the cypherpunk movement -- gave it [a positive review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZIEYW08RO13/) I decided that it would be worth a read. While the book does center on [Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), [Greenberg](http://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/) does an admirable job of tracing the history of the [cypherpunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) and describing what in the future we will probably refer to as a sequel to [the cryptowars](http://www.amazon.com/Crypto-Rebels-Government-Privacy-Digital/dp/0140244328). It is a recommended read.
