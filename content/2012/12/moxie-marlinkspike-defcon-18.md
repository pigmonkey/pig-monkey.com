In [his talk from Defcon 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG0KrT6pBPk) ([transcript available](http://privacy-pc.com/news/changing-threats-to-privacy-moxie-marlinspike-on-privacy-threats.html)), [Moxie](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/) argues that what we were preparing for was fascism and what we got was social democracy. For me it was an eye-opening explanation, and one that I think is important to understand given the ever-increasing [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) of technologies that are a not only a danger to personal privacy but can also grow to [threaten free thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOk4Y4inVY).
