Title: I try to avoid being a topic-specific blog.

I don't want this to be a blog that is only about [backpacking](/tags/wilderness/), or [bikes](/categories/bicycle/), or [Linux](/categories/linux/). I want to cover all of my interests -- which range widely -- in a way that others don't (or can't). I dislike it when other blogs publish long posts that only regurgitate what others wrote, or simply latch onto a popular topic without adding anything new to the discussion. I only [began blogging again in September](/2012/09/15/mark-two/), which makes for a small selection of posts in [this year's archives](https://pig-monkey.com/2012/) to evaluate. Looking back, I'm pleased with the diversity of topics covered.
