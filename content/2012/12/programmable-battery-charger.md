I went with the [Maha PowerEx MH-C9000](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NLUSLM) that I [mentioned last year](http://pig-monkey.com/2011/09/25/sanyo-eneloop-rechargeable-batteries/). Since purchasing the charger a couple weeks ago, I've been geeking out about batteries. I've labelled all of my [Eneloops](http://www.eneloop.info/) and started a database where I log the purchase date, capacity, and other information. I've put the database in [git](http://git-scm.com/) so that I can track the performance of an individual battery over time. [The database is on GitHub](https://github.com/pigmonkey/battery).
