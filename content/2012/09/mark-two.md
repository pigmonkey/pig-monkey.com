Hi there. It's been a while.

I took a year off from blogging. That wasn't intentional. I just didn't have anything to say for a while. Then I did have something to say, but I was tired of how the website looked. If the design doesn't excite me I tend not to want to blog. (Call me vain, but I want my words to look good.) And redesigning the website -- well, that requires an entirely different set of motivations to tackle. It took me some time to get that motivation, and then before I knew it we were here: 10 days short of a year.

During the development process I referred to this design as "mark two", as it was the second idea I tried out.

The website still runs on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). The blog is still powered by [Vellum](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-vellum), my personal blog application. I've been hacking in it for over a year now (even when this website was inactive) and it is much improved since the [last time](/2011/06/move-django/) I mentioned it. In the past six months I've seen the light of CSS preprocessors. All of the styling for this design is written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and uses the excellent [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) framework. The responsive layout is built with [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/).

If you're interested in these technical details, you will also be interested to know that the entire website is now open-source. [You can find it on GitHub](https://github.com/pigmonkey/pig-monkey.com). Fork it, hack it, or borrow some of my CSS for your website.

The other big news is that I have begun to categorize blog posts. Yeah, it's 2012 and I'm a little late to the party on that one. You may recall that I only began to tag posts [in 2008](/2008/06/beautifying/). As it stands right now, all posts are just placed in the great big ameba of a category called "General". Eventually, they will all have more meaningful categories -- I hope. But it will be a while.

Things ought to be more active around here for the foreseeable future.
