If you're at all interested in bikes, lightweight backpacking, or a combination thereof, you must read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Centre-Earth-Richard-Crane/dp/0593012917).

In 1986, Dick and Nick rode lightweight, steel race bikes from the Bay of Bengal across Bangladesh, up and over the Himalaya, across the Tibetan Plateau, and through the Gobi desert to the point of the earth furthest from the sea. They were sawing their toothbrushes in half and cutting extraneous buckles off of their panniers before "bikepacking" (or "ultralight backpacking") was a thing. The appendix includes a complete gear list and relevant discussion.
