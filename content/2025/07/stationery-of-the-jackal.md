Title: Stationery of the Jackal

My [critique of frivolous details in The Day of the Jackal](/2025/07/tribulations-of-the-jackal/) continues.

In the third episode, there's a scene where our titular assassin is doing some computing and we see his pen in the corner of the frame. It isn't in focus but is obviously a fountain pen. I immediately lose interest in whatever he's doing and say to myself "[Ah, bella penna](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9BT7m0Uf0MA)."<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ripley"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ripley" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>

A few shots later we get a close-up of the pen and notebook. The pen is clearly a Kaweco Sport. So, [he could do better](/2025/04/pilot-elite/), but anytime I see someone use a fountain pen my opinion of them goes up. I can't identify the notebook, but the paper is grid-lined, looks to be A6 in size, and it doesn't seem to feather much with his ink. I approve. The nib is probably a Fine based on the size of the writing. Good choice. The ink is a rich blue. Always classy. I'm more of a blue-black man myself, but every now and again I can get down with a little Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-peki or similar. Maybe this Jackal character is all-right.

I judge a man by his stationery.

        <li id="fn:ripley"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:ripley" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> The recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley_(TV_series)">Ripley</a> TV show approaches perfection because, unlike The Day of the Jackal, it revels in all the minor details. (Also, that lighting.) One of the things on my aspirational to-do list for the past year or so has been to watch Ripley again and make a super-cut of every time someone says "bella penna". Because I'm weird like that. It is one of my favorite parts of the show. The pen doesn't really matter to the plot at all, yet at the same time it communicates most of what you need to know about the character. And anyone who EDCs a fountain pen fantasizes about others acknowledging it.</li>
