Title: Up-Armoring My Face

In January 2024 I decided that I was going to start to wear sunscreen on my face every day. Ambient radiation is no good. Helios wants to kill you. [These are truly the last days](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/track/the-dead-flag-blues). *Et cetera*.

What holds one back from wearing sunscreen every day is that [American sunscreens are shit](https://web.archive.org/web/20220701130702/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/07/us-sunscreen-ingredients-outdated-technology-better-eu-asia/661433/). They do the job, but they feel heavy, leave a white cast, and are generally not the sort of thing you can throw on and forget about. As such, connoisseurs of anti-radiation face-armor opt for products from Asia. I have spent the past 15 months purchasing a number of different bottles, tossing something on my face every day, and spelunking the depths of [/r/AsianBeauty](https://old.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/) and the related corners of the blog-o-sphere for data on previous engagements.

First, Asian sunscreens generally come in one of three types: Essence, Milk, or Gel. Milk is so-called because it comes out similar to milk: white and runny. Essence is squeezed out of the tube with a viscosity and consistency reminiscent of the typical American product. (If we were sticking with the diary analogy, I'd call this one Greek yogurt). Gel is somewhere in between the two (low-fat yogurt?). Milk tends to be the most durable. Essence is more moisturizing. I like both Milk and Essence, and have no time for Gel.

The Internet will tell you that the best (or "HG" in Youth-speak -- eventually I learned that this is an abbreviation for "holy grail") sunscreen is [Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Milk](https://www.shiseido.co.jp/anessa/products/suncare/perfect_uv_sm/) from Nippon. This is the one I bought first. I did not like it initially, but I tried it again after a few months and decided that The Internet was correct. The problem I first had was that I was not applying enough. A lifetime of [shitty American sunscreens](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/18/1251919831/sunscreen-effective-better-ingredients-fda) had trained me to apply as little sunscreen as possible. After a few months of playing around with products that are actually good, I figured out the proper amount (the [two finger thing](https://curology.com/blog/the-two-finger-rule-for-sunscreen/) is a good guide, but the runniness of Milk-variants require a little more), and, lo, when applied properly and in the correct amount, Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Milk does work great. It is one of the few that stands up well to sweat and Extreme Activityâ„¢. Unfortunately, it is expensive. So I save this for when I know I'm going to be out all day, ball deep in sack sweat.

For every other day of the year, I have settled on Rohto Mentholatum Skin Aqua Super Moisture UV Essence. I can toss this one on in the morning, forget about it a few minutes later, and -- as long as I don't get wet -- it works all day. (All of these things say you're supposed to reapply every couple hours, but I rarely think to do that.) This one is cheaper than the Anessa, so I can apply it everyday without feeling like I'm breaking the bank.

One of these two products goes on my face every morning, as well as my neck and ears. It covers the whole face. If I'm outside in the sun, I probably have a hat covering my forehead and sunglasses covering my eyes, but I still up-armor the whole face. It doesn't matter what the weather is, or what my plans for the days are. Developing the habit is the key to preparedness. On sunny days, the same product goes on my arms. I don't believe in body-part-specific sunscreen, though my extensive research has shown that some Beauty Bloggers disagree with me.

I order this stuff from both [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/) and [Stylevana](https://www.stylevana.com/), and have had good experiences with both. I gather that Jeff Bezos will sell you some of these products, but I don't trust his store for anything I'm going to put on or in my body.
