I may have given [the impression that the Harambe System is the only muscle building equipment I use](/2025/07/muscle-machine/), but there are two exceptions to that. I've been using a [Gripmaster Pro](https://prohands.net/collections/shop-page/products/pro?variant=15249004462139) for the past 10 years, and a [Captains of Crush Gripper](https://ironmind.com/product-info/ironmind-grippers/captains-of-crush-grippers/) for a bit longer.

Back in 2015, shortly after I first met [Ed Calderon](https://www.edsmanifesto.com/), he was using my body to demonstrate for [Mark Denny](https://dogbrothers.com/guro-marc-crafty-dog-denny/) a selection of the BDSM techniques he had learned from Japanese prostitutes.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:dontaskdonttell"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:dontaskdonttell" title="see footnote">1</a></sup> In the moments of clarity between pain, I was impressed by the strength of his individual fingers. Later, when we were decent, I asked him about it and he pointed me to the Gripmaster Pro. I bought one.

I keep the Gripmaster at my desk at work, and the Captains of Crush Gripper at my desk at home, and use both the way The Youth use their so-called "fidget spinners", rather than as part of any sort of purposeful program.
