Back in May I received an email, improperly routed to my spam folder, which contained my (long-expected) invitation to join the Illuminati. I've yet to receive further details, but I figure I'm basically in at this point. It isn't like they're going to send me a secret decoder ring in the mail.

This is my second favorite recruitment offer. The first being when, in the year of our lord two thousand and eighteen (or was it '17), I received a phone call from a (purported) CIA recruiter (allegedly) encouraging me to apply for a role in the (recently renamed) Directorate of Operations.

It is periodic acknowledgement like this that leads me to believe I am making the right life choices.
