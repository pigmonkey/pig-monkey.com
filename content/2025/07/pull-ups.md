Title: Further Fingering

Since jumping on the variable resistance train a few years ago, the number of bodyweight exercises I do has steadily diminished. One thing I do still practice -- pretty much daily -- are pull-ups.

I've never owned one of those pull-up bar contraptions you install in a doorway. But I live in San Francisco, where we more-or-less stopped building housing after the reign of King George V. This means I have crown moulding along my walls and above my doorways. I just hop up there, hang from my fingers, and do pull-ups from that. Another application of [finger strength](/2025/07/fingering/).

The first time I tried this, the sharp edge of the moulding was rather painful on my fingers. A bit of padding was wanted. I remembered I had some old [pot handle covers](https://www.amazon.com/Skillet-Resistant-Holders-Kitchen-Washable/dp/B08YJZTHKL/) that I never use. I put those between my finger tips and the wood, and it worked great. It gives a little padding, and increases the surface area I'm gripping on just a skosh. These have since lived near my bathroom door. My morning routine after getting out of bed is: piss, pull-ups, ablutions.

I can't remember the last time I did a pull-up from a bar, so I'm not sure how the difficulty of my practice compares. But pulling myself up using a small ledge is a better analogue for any sort of [real world activity](https://www.itstactical.com/fitcom/functional-strength-fitcom/can-you-physically-save-yourself/).
