I listen to [65daysofstatic](https://www.65daysofstatic.com/) and their generative noise program [Wreckage Systems](https://youtube.com/65propaganda/live). My [favorite advertisement](/media/audio/wreckage_systems-future_without_future.mp3) for Wreckage Systems is on the [Debris](https://www.discogs.com/release/22166800-65daysofstatic-Debris) album (a blind stumbling through the cratered landscape of the musical-industrial complex):

> The future without future. The ceaseless turmoil of now. A world of fog and foreboding. Wreckage Systems are the lamp by your side. The stranger who walks beside you. The hand in the dark. Wreckage Systems is the scaffolding that we erect to stop the crushing wave of the heavy sky falling down and around us, dissolving into the ocean that is already lapping around our ankles. Join us and help the dedicated team over at 65LABS expand their noise as together we strive towards utopia.
