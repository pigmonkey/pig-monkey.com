Title: Titanium Tongue Tool

One of my recent projects has been to reevaluate my dental ablutions. As it turns out, mankind's knowledge has progressed since I was first taught to brush my teeth as a toddler, and some of my practices wanted updating.

I bought my first tongue scraper back in 2018. It was one of those [U-shaped copper ones from India](https://mastermedi.co/products/tongue-scraper-copper). I used it occasionally, but did not incorporate it into my daily ritual until I began this reevaluation at the end of last year. I have decided that I do like using tongue scrapers, and want to do so daily, but I always found the two-handed nature of this style vaguely annoying. I had previously come across the one-handed models that are more spooned shaped, and had even seen that [Tongue Sweeper makes a titanium version](https://tonguesweeper.com/collections/all-tongue-sweepers/products/model-titanium-pro). As an addict for anything titanium, I immediately wanted this for no other reason than it was titanium. But at $42 I could not justify the cost.

Then last month I happened to see the [Tongue Sweeper Titanium Pro on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/166789944345) for only $27. Obviously I bought it.

Given the price discrepancy, I assumed this was going to be a knock-off, or a unit from a box that fell off a truck somewhere. But it shipped direct from Tongue Sweeper Actual, is serialized, and included a certificate of authenticity in the box.

So now I clean my tongue with titanium every morning, and I feel like a million bucks doing it.

That old copper U-shaped one weighs 30 grams. I have never travelled with it, and would never travel with it. The new titanium one? 7 grams (including the colored silicone ring). I bought this after returning from my recent 3-week bicycle tour this Spring, so I haven't actually travelled with it yet. But at 7 grams, I probably will.
