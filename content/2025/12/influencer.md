[Influencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_(film)) is mistakenly billed as a horror film, but is actually an inspirational story of a young woman using her murder island to try to make the world a better place by pruning the insta-face-twat-tok-tuber population.

I eagerly awaited the sequel, and can now report that [Influencers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencers_(film)) is even better than the first one. I am here for the Influencer Cinematic Universe.

Whoever composed the score clearly spent a lot of time listening to [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo_(soundtrack)) (and who among us has not). Specifically they seem to be a big fan of [track 4](https://www.nin.wiki/Pinned_And_Mounted).
