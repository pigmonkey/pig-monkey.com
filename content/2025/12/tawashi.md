Title: Concerning the Tawashi

I scrub my dishes and kitchen counter tops with a [Kamenoko Tawashi](https://en.kamenoko-tawashi.co.jp/). The palm fiber of the Tawashi is stiff enough for a good scouring, but does not scratch anything. It doesn't hold onto food scraps the way some other brushes do. It dries relatively quickly when hung from its wire loop or placed in a two-piece soap dish, thus supporting [my war on sponges](/2019/02/scouring/). I use the #1 size, which is small enough to fit comfortably in my hand and to be shoved into drink ware. It is the perfect kitchen brush.

I use the same brush for about two years before replacing it. Every few months I toss it in [the kitchen autoclave](/2019/12/pressure-cooker-sterilization/). I could keep them for longer, but I give my Tawashi enough unintentional haircuts when cleaning knives that I'm usually ready for a new one after a couple years.

The only other brushes I use in the kitchen are a [bottle brush](https://www.oxo.com/bottle-brush.html) and straw brush. I also have one of those [chainmail scrubbers](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00FKBR1ZG/) for my cast iron, but the Tawashi gets used much more often.

The Tawashi, [my Sal Suds spray](/2019/07/cleaner/), and my pink [Mamison gloves](https://nymag.com/strategist/2017/05/the-best-rubber-gloves-for-dishwashing-are-from-korea.html) complete my kitchen ablution armaments. (The pink color is critical for maximum cleaning.)

Tawashi are made by a number of manufacturers. Many are garbage. Those from Kamenoko are consistently good. I avoid it if it does not come in the orange wrapper with the picture of the turtle on it.
