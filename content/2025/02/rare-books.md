Title: I spent the afternoon at this year's rare book fair.

In contrast to [last year's fair](/2024/02/antiquarian-book-fair/), at [this event](https://rarebooksla.com/rare-books-san-francisco-2025/) I only spotted one Ed Abbey book and maybe 3 or 4 Steinbecks. Instead the strategy shifted to the Beats. Plenty of Ginserberg, Snyder, and a first of Naked Lunch that tempted me.

One booth had a pile labelled "assorted tabloids" in which I found a copy of [Search & Destroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RE/Search_Publications#Search_&_Destroy) No. 4. I took a photo of it, knowing that [Vale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Vale) was tabling somewhere in the [Zine Fest](https://www.sfzinefest.org/) section. When I later found him I showed him the photo and told him that when your own work shows up at the antiquarian fair, it means you're old.
