Title: Long have I wished for a good quality USB power bank with a switch.

Sometimes I want to leave a device connected to the battery, but powered off. Last November I stopped looking for a power bank and instead [bought a couple short cables with switches](https://www.amazon.com/JSADZKJ-USB-Extension-Support-Printer/dp/B0D8NN2XBZ). I plugged one into one of my trusted Anker power banks, slapped a couple ranger bands on there, and have been living the dream ever since.

There's nothing quite as satisfying as a good rocker switch.
