Title: There's this leather daddy I keep running into at different shows.

He's about 8 ft tall and dresses like Brian Eno circa 1974 but with more makeup. Anytime I go to a show that I know nothing about, I look around to see if I spot him towering over the crowd. If he's there, I know it'll be a good show.

He should publish an iCalendar feed.
