Title: Typing Nightmare

I was reading someone blogging about blogging, wherein the author critiqued using a static site generator for a blog by exclaiming "you can't even post without a computer!" This statement implicitly proposes the possibility of publishing a blog post with something other than a computer. I assume the unmentioned alternative here is a telephone. For me this is nightmare fuel.

You know how sometimes you'll have a dream where you need to run, and then suddenly the air is molasses and you can only move in slow motion? I've had dreams like that, but instead of needing to run I need to type a message, and instead of the air becoming molasses I find I only have a phone. Nightmare.

I don't understand how people internet without a keyboard. My thumbs don't work like that.
