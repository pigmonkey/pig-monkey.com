Two of my favorite artists on Bandcamp are [Makeup and Vanity Set](https://makeupandvanityset.bandcamp.com/) and [Pilotpriest](https://pilotpriest.bandcamp.com/). Both were recently involved with [tech-noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_noir) films.

Pilotpriest [scored](https://pilotpriest.bandcamp.com/album/come-true-original-motion-picture-score), directed, and wrote [Come True](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_True) under the alias Anthony Scott Burns. This is the first feature length film of his that I've seen. His previous short works include [a Tron sequel](https://vimeo.com/24927298) and, with [Ash Thorp](https://altcinc.com/), [Lost Boy](https://vimeo.com/188650521). Both are excellent. Come True follows a teenage runaway who joins a sleep study at a local university in order to have a place to sleep, and proceeds to awaken some sort of demonic universal id. It is full of neon and moody lighting and retro tech and hex dumps and I loved it. I think of it as a sort of [Strange Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Days_(film)) by way of [Stranger Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things). There's not much dialogue, but I thought the lead actress did a great job of selling the character's path from confusion to discomfort to terror.

Makeup and Vanity Set, using the nom de guerre Matthew Putsi, scored the third season of [The Girlfriend Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girlfriend_Experience_(TV_series)#Season_3). The show follows a neuroscientist hooker who uses her sex work experience to help build a manipulative artificial intelligence. It is quite weird, but I enjoyed the aesthetics of the show. Reviewers seem to criticize it for feeling very cold and sterile and antiseptic, but I think that fits with the theme of sex-divorced-from-emotion. I enjoy my tech-noir, and this is that. It felt somewhat [Gibsonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson). I wouldn't have been surprised to learn at the end of the show that Huburtus Bigend was orchestrating things. [The score](https://matthewpusti.bandcamp.com/album/the-girlfriend-experience-season-3-original-series-soundtrack), as expected, is excellent.

The only previous film score work I've seen from MAVS (excluding the three seconds he had in [Godzilla vs Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_vs._Kong)) is [Hit TV](https://vimeo.com/165450397), which also satisfies.
