I [carry Fix It Sticks for screwing](/2018/04/screw/) and [small Westcott scissors for snipping](/2019/09/westcott-scissors/). Since learning about them last year [on Jerking the Trigger](https://jerkingthetrigger.com/2020/10/08/the-edc-tool-roll-knipex-cobra-pliers-87-00-100/), I've carried [Knipex 87-00-100 Cobra Pliers](https://www.kctool.com/knipex-87-00-100-cobra-xs-pliers/) for gripping. There are times when a classic multitool, like a Leatherman, is preferable, but I find this selection is more functional for most of my mobile tool needs.

I measure the baby Knipex pliers at an overall length of 103 millimeters and a mass of 60 grams. They are an excellent purchase.
