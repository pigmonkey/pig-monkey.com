I use an [Ultralite Sacks Trail Wallet](https://ultralitesacks.com/collections/all-products-kits/products/ultralight-minimalist-trail-wallet) to carry a few items that support my [Rudy Project Rydon eyewear](/2016/08/rudy/). I have six or eight of these simple cuben fiber zippered pouches floating around for different uses, either from Ultralite Sacks or [Zpacks](https://zpacks.com/products/wallet-zip-pouch).

I've [previously mentioned my infatuation with the ImpactX2 Photochromic Laser Red lenses](/2018/11/laser-red/). These remain my lense of choice 99% of the time. But sometimes I want a polarized lens (such as when on water), or one with lower light transmission (such as when the sun is low during the equinox), or one with higher contrast (such as when on snow), or one that is not photochromic (such as when in an enclosed vehicle for an extended period of time). All of these conditions are satisfied by the Polar3FX brown lenses. I carry these in the wallet inside of the small microfiber lens pouch that Rudy provides.

A microfiber bag is useful when I want to put the Rydons inside my pack. The bag doesn't provide any crush protection, but prevents the lenses from getting scratched. I use the bag that came with [my old Revision Sawfly optics](/2007/06/revision-sawfly/).

I also carry a full-size microfiber cloth. This is the same large model [I use to protect my laptop screen](/2021/05/x260-panel/). It is slightly redundant with the microfiber bag -- both can be used to clean the lenses -- but I find the larger size of the dedicated cloth useful.

There's enough room in the wallet to store [my Cablz retention strap](/2021/01/cablz/). I have kept this attached to the Rydons most of the time since purchasing the strap last year, but if I remove it, it goes in the wallet.

The wallet can fit [a 5ml spray bottle](https://www.litesmith.com/mini-spray-bottles/) filled with [ROR](/2019/05/ror/). That's not something I carry around on a daily basis, but I'd consider tossing it in for an extended trip.

As you may have gathered, one of my pet peeves is dirty optics. I want to protect my corneas from UV radiation and impact, but I also want vision that is high definition and high fidelity. The Rydons, coupled with this small and lightweight kit, support that objective.
