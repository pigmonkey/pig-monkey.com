Title: I published my database of pressure cooking times.

A couple years ago I scraped all of the [pressure cooking time tables from Hip Pressure Cooking](https://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/) into CSV files for storage in [my exocortex](https://github.com/pigmonkey/notes.sh). For things I cook regularly, I keep my own notes on preferred times, water ratios, etc. But when cooking something new, I find that having an easily greppable, offline database of guidelines is invaluable. Today I moved the CSV files out of my private notes annex and [published them as their own git repository](https://github.com/pigmonkey/pressure-cooking-times).
