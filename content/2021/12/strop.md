Title: I hang my strop on my fridge with a magnetic hook.

All of my sharpening supplies live in a box in a closet. Out of sight, out of mind. Once I moved the strop to a place where I see it every day, I began to use it much more often -- both for kitchen knives and pocket knives. Frequent stropping keeps the knives in better shape, and reduces the frequency with which they need to be sharpened.

My current strop solution is a [rubberized cork strop](https://bernalcutlery.com/products/strop-rubberized-cork-14-x-3) coated with [boron carbide and chromium oxide](https://bernalcutlery.com/products/borachrome-1-oz-boron-carbide-chromium-oxide-fine-deburring-compound), as [explained by Bernal Cutlery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA-Fnoyqxxk).
