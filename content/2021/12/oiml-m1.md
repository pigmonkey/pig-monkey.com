Title: OIML-M1 Scale Calibration

Back in 2017 one of the ladies at [Red Blossom Tea](https://redblossomtea.com/) chastised me for not using a tea scale. I went home and ordered an [American Weigh Scales SC-2kg](https://awscales.com/amw-2000-x-0-1g-portable-digital-scale/), which measures up to 2kg with 0.1g resolution. It seemed adequate for the task, and compact enough that I wouldn't mind it taking up a little room in a drawer if I ended up not using it frequently.

At the start of 2020 I decided to become an adult and begin to measure all solid kitchen ingredients by weight instead of volume, so the SC-2kg began to see much more frequent use.

That went along swimmingly for about a year, until the beginning of 2021 when I became curious about the accuracy of the scale. Nothing in particular prompted this curiosity. I just enjoy knowing that the tools in my life are both precise and accurate. As [helpfully explained by LabBalances](https://labbalances.net/blogs/blog/guide-to-calibration-weights), there are a number of different scale calibration systems in the world. All of it is overkill for use in my personal kitchen, but I decided to look into the OIML-M1 class from the [International Organization of Legal Metrology](https://www.oiml.org/).

The calibration procedure for the SC-2kg requires 1kg and 2kg weights. I found a good deal on a set of 2kg, 1kg, 20g and 10g OIML-M1 certified weights on eBay. According to OIML-M1, a 1kg calibration weight must be accurate within 50mg. A 2kg calibration weight must be within 100mg. That'd get me a pretty accurate bowl of rice.

When I received the weights I found that the SC-2kg reported the correct measurement for all 4 calibration weights. I also tried the calibration weights on my [MyWeigh UltraShip Ultra-35](https://myweigh.com/product/ultraship-series/), which is the scale I've had [kicking around since 2009](/2009/06/digital-scale/) for measuring backpacking gear. It only claims to have 2g resolution up to 1kg, and 5g resolution up to 16 kilograms. I found it to be accurate within its claimed resolution.

So all of this was for naught. Both of my scales were already accurate and not in need of calibration. But I really enjoy having these OIML calibration weights and knowing that my measurements conform to the standards of the universe.
