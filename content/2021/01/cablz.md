Title: Cablz Eyewear Retention

I've previously [mentioned my fondness](/2016/08/rudy/) for [Rudy Rydon](https://www.rudyprojectna.com/products/rydon?variant=31503744630849) eyewear (particularly with the [photochromic laser red lenses](/2018/11/laser-red/)). One of the benefits of the Rydons is the adjustability of the temples and the nose pad, which allow for a secure, custom fit. This makes added retention via a strap unnecessary for securing the Rydons on the face, yet I've come to appreciate having a retainer attached simply because it allows me to drop the eyewear around my neck when I don't need it. This offers more security than pushing them up onto the crown of my head or hanging them over the edge of my shirt or pocket, without requiring the hassle of putting them away in a pack.

For this application I've come to like the [Cablz Zipz Adjustable Eyewear Retainer](https://www.cablz.com/collections/eyewear-retainers/products/the-original-cablz-zipz-adjustable?variant=32627715833903). I use the 12 inch version. These are made of a coated, stainless steel wire. When you're wearing the eyewear, the wire sits up off the neck so you don't feel the retainer at all. When you're hanging it around your neck, it is thin and light enough that you soon forget it is there (this is also a result of the lightness of the Rydons, of course). The zip allows the length of the retainer to adjust from about 6 inches to 12 inches. At the smallest setting this keeps the Rydons tight on my face, but since that is not what I'm looking for I keep it adjusted about half way. At roughly 9 inches in length, I find that I can easily don and doff the eyewear, and that they sit at a comfortable position on my chest when I'm hanging them around my neck. The "universal" silicon ends of the retainer grab securely on the Rydon temples.

Cablz isn't the only company to offer this style of retainer.

The [Croakies ARC Endless](https://www.croakies.com/product/arc-endless-2) is the same basic idea. I bought one to try out, but found it to be inferior. The silicon ends are significantly thicker and less comfortable behind the ear. I could bend the Rydon temples to account for this extra thickness, but I appreciate that the Cablz retainer requires no adjustment of the eyewear. With the Croakies, the pieces you grab to tighten the retainer are quite small. You're adjusting the retainer blind by reaching behind your head, so the haptics are important. I found the Croakies difficult to use when wearing gloves. The Cablz adjustment pieces are large enough to be easy to use whether gloved or gloveless.

The equivalent from Chums is the [Adjustable Orbiter](https://chums.com/collections/stainless-steel/products/adjustable-orbiter). It only adjusts from 10 inches to 15.5 inches, which is too large for my needs, so I didn't buy one to try.

I recommend the retainer from Cablz. It provides a simple but helpful augmentation to my eyeball protection system.
