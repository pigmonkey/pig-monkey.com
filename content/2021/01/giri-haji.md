The story concerns a police detective, his yakuza brother, and their series of poor life choices. Everything about it is very well done. [The show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri/Haji) is described as "cancelled", but the first season is a complete story and, as excellent as it is, I think continuing with the characters in a second season would only lessen the experience of the first.
