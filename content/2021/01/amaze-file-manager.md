I'm not sure how one is expected to use a computer without the ability to view and manipulate the file system. For the past few years I've solved this problem with [Amaze File Manager](https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager) which is a simple, open source file manager that in a world of sane defaults would be entirely unremarkable.
