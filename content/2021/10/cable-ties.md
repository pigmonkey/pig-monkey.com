But I've become quite smitten with [Ringke Silicon Cable Ties](https://www.amazon.com/Ringke-Silicone-Organizer-Management-Fastening/dp/B07X388122/). Unlike hook and loop, they don't stick to things that you don't want them to stick to. Most importantly, they are easy to open and close while wearing full-fingered gloves. This makes them great for cables you carry around while out and about in meatspace, such as earbuds and power cables. I've only been using them since July, so I can't speak to durability, but I see no reason they should not satisfy in that department.

For thicker cables that need to be restrained with a bit more vigor, I am fond of the new [Voile Nano Straps](https://www.voile.com/nano-series-straps.html).
