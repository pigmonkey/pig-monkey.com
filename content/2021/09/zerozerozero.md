Title: ZeroZeroZero (or triple aught, as I call it) is something like a blend of The Godfather and Sicario.

[The series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroZeroZero) follows a shipment of cocaine from Mexico, through Africa, to Italy. Like the [other](/2021/01/giri-haji/) [series](/2018/12/counterpart/) I've recommended recently, it can be described as a stylish, slow burning neo-noir with just the right amount of gunplay.

I usually consider Mogwai to be a poor substitute for [Godspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godspeed_You!_Black_Emperor), but [their soundtrack](https://mogwai.bandcamp.com/album/zerozerozero) isn't bad.
