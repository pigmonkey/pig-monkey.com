Title: In 2018 I upgraded my razor to a Feather AS-D2.

I [mentioned back then](/2018/03/feather/) that I liked the Feather blades in the AS-D2, but that they provided fewer shaves than the blades I used in my old Merkur razor. This raises the cost-per-shave. I just today threw away the last Feather blade from the box of 100 that I purchased with the AS-D2. That box cost me $26 and lasted me roughly 1300 days. Call it maybe $7.75 per year. I shave with [the same soap](https://shop.drbronner.com/collections/pure-castile-bar-soap/products/baby-unscented-pure-castile-bar-soap) I use for washing hands and body, so the blades are my only recurring expense specific to shaving.

I remain pleased with this setup.
