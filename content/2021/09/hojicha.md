I pedaled over to Japantown a couple months ago to restock rice and umeboshi. While there I visited [ChaTo](https://www.sfchato.com/), a tea shop I had heard about but never been to. I had a craving for genmaicha, which I was sure they could satisfy ([they did](https://www.sfchato.com/genmaicha)). But the real victory of the day was leaving with a bag of their [Sumibi Houjicha](https://www.sfchato.com/product-page/houjicha-1). This is my new favorite tea.

I've [previously mentioned my fondness for kukicha](/2018/12/kukicha/). *Kuki* means stem or twig, *cha* means tea, *hoji* means roasted, *sumibi* means charcoal fire. So kukicha is tea made of stems instead of leaves. It can be roasted or not. I like it roasted, which seems to be more common on this side of the Pacific Rim. Sumibi hojicha, then, is a charcoal roasted tea. It consists of 60% stems and 40% leaves, so it isn't a pure kukicha. Instead it is a blend of kukicha and sencha. Most hojicha, I'm told, is made using bancha, which is harvested later in the season and considered a lower-grade leaf. Sencha is the premium early harvest stuff. The sumibi hojicha has a great smell and an amazing taste. The roasting gets rid of most of the caffeine. If you like kukicha, I bet you'll like this stuff.

ChaTo also sent me away with a sample of their [Houjicha Shizuoka](https://www.sfchato.com/product-page/houjicha), which is lighter in taste (but darker in color) and very sweet. I like it as a cold tea, but the sweetness of the tea tastes wrong to me when brewed hot. I recommend sticking to the sumibi.
