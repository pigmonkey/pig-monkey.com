I'm just some guy, you know?

I value autonomy, movement, and diversity. I have a tendency to be distrustful of authority. I prefer decentralized, [rhizomatic](https://github.com/pigmonkey/atheoryofpower/blob/master/chapters/09-forward_to_rhizome.md) networks to centralized systems. I dislike writing autobiography.

The best way to learn about me is to [explore my writings](/archives/). This website functions as the central portal for my online presence. It is a record of many goings and comings, doings and beings; stories, symbols and meanings. Gossamer threads that may be woven into a larger web: a story of this age of the world.

[According to Google](/2024/12/all-watched-over/) I am well-prepared, experienced, tidy, and organized.

You may wish to peruse a [periodically updated list of books that I've read](/books/).
