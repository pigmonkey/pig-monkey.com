I'm just some guy, you know?

I value autonomy, movement, and diversity. I have a tendency to be distrustful of authority. I prefer decentralized, [rhizomatic](http://www.jeffvail.net/2007/01/what-is-rhizome.html) networks to centralized systems. I dislike writing autobiography.

The best way to learn about me is to [explore my writings](/archives/). This website functions as the central portal for my online presence. It is a record of many goings and comings, doings and beings; stories, symbols and meanings. Gossamer threads that may be woven into a larger web: a story of this age of the world.

The website is generated by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/), hand-forged in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). The code is entirely [open-source](https://github.com/pigmonkey/pig-monkey.com).

If you wish to contact me, you are encouraged to [encrypt](http://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html) messages with my [public key](/key.asc). Additional identities may be verified via [id.txt](/id.txt).
