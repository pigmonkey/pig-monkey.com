Most of my code may be [found on GitHub](http://github.com/pigmonkey). You should go there and [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) something.


## [backitup](https://github.com/pigmonkey/backitup)

backitup is a simple bash script to execute a program if a certain amount of time has passed.


## [Boxes](https://github.com/pigmonkey/boxes)

Various [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) configurations for fun and profit.


## [Cryptshot](https://github.com/pigmonkey/cryptshot)

Open and mount a LUKS volume before performing a backup, defaulting to [rsnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org/).


## [droidsync](https://github.com/pigmonkey/droidsync)

Simple bash scripts I use to exfiltrate and infiltrate data from my Android phone. They are small wrappers around rsync, which I use on my phone thank to [SSHelper](https://arachnoid.com/android/SSHelper/).


## [Firewarden](https://github.com/pigmonkey/firewarden)

Firewarden is a bash script used to open a program within a private [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail) sandbox.


## [Geoweather](https://github.com/pigmonkey/geoweather)

Geolocated weather forecasts using the power of the World Wide Web.


## [GOESImage](https://github.com/pigmonkey/goesimage)

GOESImage is a bash script which downloads the latest imagery from the [NOAA Geostationary Operational Environment Satellites](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php) and sets it as the desktop background via [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/).


## [hostsctl](https://github.com/pigmonkey/hostsctl)

hostsctl allows you to block advertisements, trackers, and other malicious activity by manipulating /etc/hosts. By taking advantage of curated lists of known bad hosts and providing an interface to easily manipulate host definitions, you can save bandwidth and stay safer online.

I took over the maintainership of hostsctl when the original author vanished.


## [Metamovie](https://github.com/pigmonkey/metamovie)

Metamovie is a simple script to fetch information about a movie and store it as [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) [metadata](https://git-annex.branchable.com/metadata/).


## [nmtrust](https://github.com/pigmonkey/nmtrust)

This project provides a simple framework for determing the trusted state of the current network connections, and taking action based on the result. It is intended to be used to activate certain services on trusted networks, and disable them when when there is a connection to an untrusted network or when there is no established network connection.


## [notes.sh](https://github.com/pigmonkey/notes.sh)

Shortcuts for easily managing text-based notes.


## [Pinit](https://github.com/pigmonkey/pinit)

Add a bookmark to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). The URL may be given via standard input, as an argument, or copied from the clipboard.


## [Spark](https://github.com/pigmonkey/spark)

Spark is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook meant to provision a personal machine running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). It is intended to run locally on a fresh Arch install (ie, taking the place of any [post-installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Post-installation)), but due to Ansible's idempotent nature it may also be run on top of an already configured machine.


## [Systools](https://github.com/pigmonkey/systools)

Miscellaneous helpers and system administration scripts.
