Last week I formatted and installed Gentoo. Out of the twenty-or-so times I've tried to install it on this computer, this is the first time it has actually worked. (I've been able to put Gentoo on any computer but this one with no problem.)
So I'm quite happy about this.

I'm still running Slackware on my laptop.
