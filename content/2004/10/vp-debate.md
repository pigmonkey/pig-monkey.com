I was only able to watch the first thirty minutes or so of tonight's VP "debate", but I must say I was quite surprised. Between all the regurgitation of last Thursday's presidential "debate" and the "my pimp is better than your pimp" talk, it seems that Edwards was in the lead (if there can be one). How did that happen? I mean, Dick Cheney can just <i>look</i> at him and Edwards would implode. He's Dick <i>frickin</i>-Cheney.
