I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0929408098/qid=1089526204/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-0713123-9406461?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >The Virus Creation Labs: A Journey into the Underground</a>. Although I have respect for <span class="removed_link">George C. Smith</span>, I didn't enjoy the book very much. It's interesting in a historical sense, but at times I find the book either too dry or not technical enough (yes, I know that's contradictory); not to mention it just seemed to read too much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060926945/qid=1089526380/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-0713123-9406461?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Masters of Deception</a>, or some other book touting the good old days of underground BBS's and those evil leet hackers.
It's short enough, so I guess if you have an interest in computer viruses, namely their history, you should pick it up and finish it in a day.
