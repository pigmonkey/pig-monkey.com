I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156027321/qid=1089402617/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-0713123-9406461?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Life of Pi</a> (school required reading) last night. The first 100 pages or so I absolutely despised (religious rants and whatnot), but after Pi became a castaway, I enjoyed the book. The book's tagline "this book will make you believe in God," holds no substance. To me, god(s) wasn't even a part of the book after page 100 or so. Oh well.

It's not your typical school required reading.
