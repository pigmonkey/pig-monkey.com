Since the beginning of December I've been trying to get a job shadow setup with <a href="http://www.f5.com/" >F5 Networks</a> down in Seattle. It was finally confirmed today and it turns out I'll be shadowing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0072127732/qid=1103150997/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-4949831-2412045?v=glance&s=books" >Brian Hatch</a>. I didn't even know he worked there.

Sweetness.
