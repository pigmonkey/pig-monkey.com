There's going to be a <span class="removed_link">political artist conference</span> May 15 & 16 in Seattle.

<blockquote>The 2004 conference is the first annual gathering of political artists from around the country and the world. The conference will consist of two days of workshops, speakers and events exploring political art. Conference participants will receive hands-on skills and practical knowledge, a broader understanding of the history and current state of political art and benefit from the rare opportunity of being able to spend a weekend in a building full of political artists from across the country. We hope to strengthen the movement of artists for global justice by linking together communities of artists whether geographically bound or connected by specific issue.

The Art of Resistance will host three nights of open events featuring film, performance, spoken word, music and visual art and a political art exhibit which will be on display during the conference.</blockquote>
