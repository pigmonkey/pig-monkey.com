I was able to skip school today and job shadow at <a href="http://www.intermec.com" >Intermec</a>. I shadowed two UNIX admins for most of the day.
It was good times.
I learned a lot, played with new toys, and spent time in the GNOC (global network operations center).
They were surprised I knew anything about Linux (I turned a couple people on to Slackware and Gentoo), and the engineering guys want me to work for them.

In other news, being in the mall when the power goes out is cool.
