I finished reading <a href="http://sivacracy.net/" >Siva Vaidhyanathan</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0814788076/qid=1078854370//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-9190355-1731345?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity</a>. It's an interesting book, if you're into copyright. Me, well, I was bored at parts, and it's not very high on my recommendation list. I suggest you go to your local bookstore and read the Afterword. If you're not getting evil glares from the management when you finish that, skim the last chapter ("The Digital Moment"). Those are the only good parts.
