I just watched the Revolutions DVD. That was an erotic experience, and I haven't even touched the second disc with the bonus features yet. Speaking of discs, it comes with a "Bonus CD-ROM" mini-cd taped on the front. I haven't looked at that yet, so I have no idea what it is.

I'm going to listen to Navras now.

And if you didn't catch it last time: my hair is black ("Noir", actually).
