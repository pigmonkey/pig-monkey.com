I picked up Neal Stephenson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060523867/qid=1081976785/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-4639429-0565463?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >The Confusion</a> yesterday. Sadly, I probably won't read it till the summer. I have a very large stack of books to read, and school doesn't help.

I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JMEW/ref=amb_center-2_81811_1/103-4639429-0565463" >Kill Bill</a>, too.
