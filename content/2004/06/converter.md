After hearing them on <a href="http://distortedcircuitry.com/" >Distorted Circuitry</a>, I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.ant-zen.com/converter/" >Converter</a>'s <a href="http://www.ant-zen.com/act/act143.htm" >Expansion Pack</a> (act143.31 and act143.32) from <a href="http://strangefortune.com/" >Strange Fortune</a>. Instead of simply coming as a normal CD, as I expected, it ended up behind two mini-cds, four tracks each. Very odd. I'm pretty sure it would be cheaper to go for one normal CD, not to mention I can't play these in any slot-loaded player (such as my car), but...it's unique, I guess.
I recommend picking the album(s) up, if you're into to (heavy) industrial. It's good stuff.
I also recommend <a href="http://strangefortune.com/" >Strange Fortune</a> if you're looking for some underground industrial. I'm pleased with them.
