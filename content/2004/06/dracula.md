I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/014143984X/qid=1087103074/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-7528118-8673429?v=glance&s=books" >Dracula</a> last night. It's a good book (far better than any adaptions of the tale), but much too long. Only the last half of the book is really concerned with Count Dracula.
