I finished reading Jack Kerouac's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140042598/qid=1086153336/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-0561931-3446552?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >On the Road</a> last night. It's one of the best books I've read, by the self-proclaimed "voice of the Beat Generation".

<blockquote>Hailed by <i>The New York Times</i> as the most beautifully executed, the clearest, and the most important utterance yet of the Beat Generation, <i>On the Road</i> is the kind of book people read, reread, and take to heart.</blockquote>

If you dislike William S. Burroughs, then don't worry. Kerouac is completely different...yet somehow the same.

So go read the book.
