I just finished reading Neal Stephenson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060523867/qid=1088641230/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-9194390-1399035" >The Confusion</a>.

It's long.

Although not as long as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380977427/ref=pd_ser_asin_1/103-9194390-1399035?v=glance&s=books" >Quicksilver</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060512806/qid=1088641422/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-9194390-1399035" >Cryptonomicon</a>.

Anywhoo, if you enjoyed Quicksilver, go read The Confusion. If you are impartial toward Quicksilver, go read The Confusion. If you didn't like Quicksilver, don't go read The Confusion.
