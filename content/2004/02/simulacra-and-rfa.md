I just realized that I never posted a few days ago when I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0791450643/qid=1077406188//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-2968678-4115247?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Reading Simulacra: Fatal Theories for Postmodernity</a>. So, yeah, I did.  It was interesting, but seemed to dragged on at certain parts. You can tell it heavily influenced The Matrix.
