I've <span class="removed_link">uploaded</span> Douglas <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/" >Rushkoff</a>'s <a href="http://www.h2k2.net" >H2K2</a> speech, <i>Human Autonomous Zones: The Real Role of Hackers</i>. A highly recommended listen.

<blockquote>How the role of hackers in society has changed. They used to be a necessary counterbalance to corporate and government power. Now, it's more like hackers are the only ones who understand the technology. They have become a balance to the power of technology itself. A discussion by renowned author Doug Rushkoff. </blockquote>
