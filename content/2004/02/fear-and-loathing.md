I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679785892/qid=1075775145//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i5_xgl14/002-3345246-4297625?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a> last night. That's a damn good book, in an LSD-induced sort of way. I Think the New York Times Book Review quote on the back does a good job of summing it up

<blockquote>The best book on the dope decade.</blockquote>

Speaking of the back, here's the excerpt they put on it:

<blockquote>We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls... But the only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge...</blockquote>

I can't wait to see what traffic Google is going to send my way because of that quote.

But, yeah, good book. And short. So read it.
