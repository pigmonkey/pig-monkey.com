Today I finally finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486225445/qid%3D1100392743/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/104-9475980-4331926" >Volume Two of Emma Goldman's Living My Life</a>. Although it's a direct continuation of the first (the first page is 504), I didn't enjoy it as much as Volume One. The meat of the book is on Soviet Russia, following her 1919 deportation from America, which I just found to be too depressing.

Everybody should read the first volume. If you feel like it, go for the second.

Now I need to figure out what happened to her after her autobiography ends (1923/24).
