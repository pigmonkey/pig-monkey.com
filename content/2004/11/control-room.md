<span class="removed_link">Control Room</span> is one of the best films I've seen this year. It documents the media's coverage in the first month of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, specifically focusing on Al-Jazeera. Or, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391024/" >as IMDB would have it</a>, "a documentary on perception of the United States's war with Iraq, with an emphasis on Al Jazeera's coverage."

As far as documentaries go, it does a good job at attempting to be balanced. One of the main characters is a P.R. person from the military at the Coalition <a href="http://www.centcom.mil/" >Command Center</a>.

If the word Al-Jazeera doesn't send you running back into a dark corner, I highly recommend watching it.
