In case you've been under a rock the past few hours, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3980553.stm" >Bush won</a>. 274 to 252 electoral votes.

It'll be interesting to see how much longer the government lasts. I doubt Bush will get the full four years.

Since leaving the country isn't an option for me, I'm in the process of tripleing my tinfoil hat.
