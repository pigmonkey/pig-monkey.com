Who else watched the press conference? It was great fun.
C-SPAN did the split screen thing so that you could always watch one candidate listen to other's response. I love watching Bush. He looks so...naive, bored, ignorant...something like that.
Do you ever get the urge to pull his ears out from his head and have him puff up his cheeks, or is that just me?
Anway, I think Kerry came out the winner in that one. I mean, I almost <i>liked</i> the guy. That takes something.

In other news, I just got a brand new (still sealed) copy of Juno Reactor's Shango for $6.00. Excuse me while I sell my soul to Half.com.
