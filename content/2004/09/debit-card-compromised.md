My debit card was declined at a gas station today. After checking to make sure that I had a balance in the account, I called up my bank's phone support to discover that my card number is part of a block that's been "compromised" from a certain merchant (they won't tell me which). Anyway, I have to wait 5 days for a new card with a new number.
