I've finally finished reading Emma Goldman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486225437/qid=1093379863/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-9394162-3376911" >Living My Life, Vol. 1</a>. It's a very good book. Even though I don't agree with all of her ideas, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that people who aren't even partial to anarchist ideals would like it.
