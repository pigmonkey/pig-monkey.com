Yesterday I went to the 9th annual <a href="http://www.boomkak.com/bakerblues/" >Mt. Baker Blues Festival</a>. It was really good, although some bands just shouldn't try to play Hendrix. You might be wondering why I went. Three reasons:
"Hubert is the heaviest, most original guitar player I've ever heard in my life and that's the truth" - Stevie Ray Vaughan
"My favorite guitarist is Hubert Sumlin." - Jimi Hendrix
"Hubert Sumlin is truly amazing!" - Eric Clapton

Yeah. I went to see him.
