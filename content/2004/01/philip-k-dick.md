I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375421513/qid=1074659085//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/102-6103567-3280103?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick</a> last night. It's a very good, highly recommended book. My favorite story is the Electric Ant.
Go read it.
