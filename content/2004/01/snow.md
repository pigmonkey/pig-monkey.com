Yesterday was a snow day. It was fun. I went over to Tina's (yeah, driving was fun). We had a snowball fight (although the snow didn't pack), went sledding (curbs hurt), watched Ice Age (strange movie), and played Lunch Money (a card game where you beat up christian school girls and steal their money). When I finally left I had to scrape my windshield, but it was raining so as soon as I scraped a spot it would freeze over with ice again. Oh well. It was dark so I ended up just looking for tail lights and, well, I'm still alive. 
 
School is cancelled again today because of the ice. I'm just laying in bed with my laptop. Quite enjoyable, actually. It doesn't look like I'll be driving anywhere today (not quite ready to die yet).
