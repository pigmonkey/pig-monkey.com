I was channel surfing and happened upon MTV2, which has playing some new Incubus video. It was pretty good. After that I went down one to MTV and they showed a still of a Britney Spears video. She was naked, except for some shiny things on her body. This made me chuckle. After that they cut to a shot of the audience, which appeared to be mainly comprised of college-age people. This made me cry. I really hoped that it would be full of middle school students because then they'd have an excuse to succumb to the corporate brain washing: they don't know any better. But college students? Unless they have a dump truck of weed, there really is no excuse.
