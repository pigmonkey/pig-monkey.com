I just realized that when I said I had finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573227021/qid=1078183002//ref=pd_ka_1/102-9664386-6960119?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Ecstasy Club</a>, I never said what it was about. Well, on a literal level it documents the rise and fall of a cult-ish rave club in San Francisco. At it's worst it's a drug-induced psychological journey through the collective mind of a bunch of ravers trying to take the human raise to the next evolutionary level through drugs and electronica. At it's best it's a paranoid vision of corporate brainwashing and mind control.

"A darkly comic contemporary fable: a brave, very funny, very knowing trip through the neo-psychedelic substrate of the wired world." - William Gibson

Read it. And don't do E.
