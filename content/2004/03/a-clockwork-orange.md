I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393312836/qid=1080701333/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/102-7557970-0328153?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >A Clockwork Orange</a>. It's an excellent book, definitely one of my favorites. If you've seen the movie, you must read the book, which is much better (or worse, depending on how you look at it). If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, then first watch the movie and then read the book. Over half the words were completely made up by Anthony Burgess, so watching the movie first helps to give you an idea of how he talks.

If you've never heard of it, the story is somewhat of a <i>1984</i> meets <i>Peter Pan</i>. A horrorshow book.

The edition of the book that I linked to includes the last chapter, which was previously unavailable in the US version and also cut out from Stanley Kubrick's movie. This really should be a sin, as the last chapter completely makes the book.

Also, a warning: the movie, and the book even more so, are definitely deserving of the R rating.
