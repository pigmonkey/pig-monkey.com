I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142003166/qid=1083793169/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-3814488-9459241?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Junky: The Definitive Text of "Junk"</a> by William S. Burroughs today. It's a good book.

I enjoyed it more than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802132952/qid=1083793228/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-3814488-9459241" >Naked Lunch</a>. The writing is easier to follow, there is a discernible plot, and less homosexual orgies.

If you don't feel like reading the book, I'll sum it up for you: don't do opium or derivatives thereof.
