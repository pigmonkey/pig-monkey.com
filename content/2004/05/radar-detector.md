My <span class="removed_link">Cobra</span> ESD-9220WX Radar/Laser Detector just arrived. It's pretty awesome.

It detects X, K, Superwide KA Band Radar, Laser (including LTI 20-20, Ultra Lyte, and ProLaser technologies), VG-2, Safety Alert and Strobe Alert signals. It's also VG-2 undetectable, so the cops can't tell that I have the detector.
Did I mention voice alert?
