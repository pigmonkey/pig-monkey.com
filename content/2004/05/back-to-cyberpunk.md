I finished reading Richard K. Morgan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345457684/qid=1085023401/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-0561931-3446552?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" >Altered Carbon</a> today. The quote on the front from the London Times sums the book up best.

<blockquote>This seamless marriage of hardcore cyberpunk and hard-boiled detective tail is an astonishing first novel.</blockquote>

Needless to say, I enjoyed it. It reminded me alot of K.W. Jeter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/2290327298/qid=1085023627/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/102-0561931-3446552?v=glance&s=books" >Noir</a>.

Though less on the detective, and more on the cyberpunk.
