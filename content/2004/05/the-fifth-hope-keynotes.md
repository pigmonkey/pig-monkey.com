The keynote speakers for <a href="http://www.2600.org/" >2600</a>'s <a href="http://www.the-fifth-hope.org/book/book-of-hope-01.html" >The Fifth Hope</a> have been <a href="http://www.2600.org/news/view/article/1945" >announced</a>.

<blockquote>On Friday, July 9th our keynote will be renowned hacker, fugitive, author, radio host, and subject of our documentary ("Freedom Downtime") Kevin Mitnick. Believe it or not, this will be Kevin's first appearance at a HOPE conference.

On Saturday, July 10th we're pleased as punch that Steve Wozniak (of Apple fame) will be giving the keynote address. His work, interests, and philanthropy go far beyond Apple however. Throughout it all, he hasn't lost his interest in the hacker world nor his understanding of what actually constitutes a hacker.

We wrap things up on Sunday, July 11th with another keynote by Jello Biafra (musician, activist, media hacker) who, despite his admitted lack of technical prowess, manages to see the big picture and how it relates to the hacker culture. Jello was our sole keynote at H2K in 2000 and gave an extended talk at H2K2 in 2002, both of which were filled to capacity. </blockquote>
