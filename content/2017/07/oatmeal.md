Title: Standard Issue Oatmeal

I go the boxing gym in the morning before work. When I wake up I throw down a small amount of yogurt and granola, but I need a second breakfast that I can easily prepare in the office after the gym. Oatmeal is a good solution. A couple years ago I started preparing my own oatmeal instead of using store-bought packets.

I started out with [The Yummy Life's Healthy Instant Oatmeal Packets recipe](http://www.theyummylife.com/Instant_Oatmeal_Packets) and tweaked it slightly to create my Standard Issue Oatmeal. At some point over the weekend I whip up a handful of servings in separate Ziploc bags that I bring in on Monday and store in my desk for the week. It only takes a few minutes to prepare the packets, and at work it is easy to dump the contents of a Ziploc into a mug, poor in hot water, stir a bit and enjoy.

* 4 ounces [Instant Rolled Oats](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VLVBTS/)
* 1 teaspoon [Oat Bran](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WG7T1K/)
* 1 teaspoon [Chia Seeds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GT5TBW)
* 2 teaspoon [Maple Sugar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJHDVG/)
* 1/8 teaspoon [Cinnamon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WS1KHM/)
* 1/8 teaspoon [Sea Salt](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BN4PP8)
* 1 tablespoon Thompson raisins

I haven't gotten tired of this recipe after eating it regularly for a couple years. The maple sugar is the key ingredient in that regard, I think. It's easy to add in dried fruit or other garnish to mix it up occasionally.
