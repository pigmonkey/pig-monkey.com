Title: Ghetto Wave

I replaced the thumbstuds on my [Dauntless MK3](http://store.tripleaughtdesign.com/Dauntless-MK3) with two small zip ties. One zip tie acts as a thumbstud for conventional opening. The other catches on the pocket, functioning as a ghetto wave. I was skeptical of how well this would work, but surprisingly the zip tie seems to function just as well as the wave on my [Emerson Mini Commander](http://emersonknives.com/shop/commander-the-knives/mini-commander-sf/). I find that a folder with some sort of automatic opening is a more practical tool.
