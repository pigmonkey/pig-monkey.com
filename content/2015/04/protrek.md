Title: A Nylon Band for the Casio Pro Trek

Last week I purchased a [Casio PRW3000-1A](http://www.casio.com/products/Watches/PRO_TREK/PRW3000-1A/). The watch is part of Casio's [Pro Trek](http://www.protrek.casio.com/) line, which replaced the old Pathfinder series. The watch combines solar power and atomic timekeeping with the features of an ABC (altitude, barometer, compass) watch -- and does it in a fairly compact package.

The Pro Treks come with a resin band, like the G-Shock series. I prefer nylon bands for both style and function. Fortunately the band attaches to the watch via a hollow tube and two screws, making it easy to replace. Unlike the G-Shock watches, it does not require an adapter. Unfortunately, the lug width on the PRW3000 is only 16mm. I bought a 16mm Marathon band to try out and, while functionally it satisfies, I don't think that such a skinny band compliments the look of the watch.

The solution was simple: cut off a piece of the 16mm [Marathon band](https://www.marathonwatch.com/product/nylon-black) and sew it onto the 24mm [Maratac Zulu band](http://www.countycomm.com/zulutwobuckle.html) that I ran on my G-Shock. It was a quick hack, and gives me the best of both worlds: a good watch and a good band.
