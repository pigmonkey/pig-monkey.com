Last month, two of us from [work](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/) went out looking for snow. There's not much in the Sierras this year, but we found some at around 8,000 feet in the [Desolation Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desolation_Wilderness). Enough to justify hauling our 'shoes up there, and to provide a good testing ground for some newly purchased gear, as well as our own prototypes.
