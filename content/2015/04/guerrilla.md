[Kilcullen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kilcullen) draws on his decades of experience in asymmetric warfare to develop his theory of [fighting small wars in the midst of a big one](http://www.amazon.com/The-Accidental-Guerrilla-Fighting-Small/dp/0199754098) and the failure of both classical counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency on the modern battlefield.

> The local fighter is therefore often an accidental guerrilla -- fighting us because we are in his space, not because he wishes to invade ours... he is engaged in "resistance" rather than "insurgency" and fights principally to be left alone.

> ...The dynamic interaction between the modern international system of nation-states (especially its self-appointed defender, the United States) and these two discrete but often interconnected and loosely cooperating classes of nonstate opponent -- terrorist and guerrilla, postmodern and premodern, nihilist and traditionalist, deliberate and accidental -- may be part of what gives todays' "hybrid wars" much of their savagery and complexity.
