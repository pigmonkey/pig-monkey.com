Shirley's [cyberpunk magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_Called_Youth) tells the story of a private security company attempting to use the distraction of a third world war to impose fascism across the United States and Europe, and the guerrillas who resist them. Although first published in the 1980s, the omnibus edition was refreshed by the author for publication in 2012, which gives it the feel of taking place [20 minutes into the future](http://i.imgur.com/cNJth4C.jpg).
