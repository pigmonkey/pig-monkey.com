Title: Lighting the Overtake

I recently purchased a [Smith Overtake](http://www.smithoptics.com/overtake) helmet. While most bicycle helmets on the market are made from styrofoam, the Overtake includes [Koroyd](http://koroyd.com/), a new material that is supposed to [revolutionize helmet safety](http://indefinitelywild.gizmodo.com/helmet-safety-is-being-revolutionized-right-now-1692246906). It also features [MIPS](http://www.mipshelmet.com/), which reduces rotational forces on the brain by allowing the helmet to slide relative to the head during an angled impact.

So the Overtake offers exceptional protection, is comfortable and notable lighter than previous helmets, and it looks pretty good<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:matte"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:matte" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>. Unfortunately, it was not immediately compatible with my light system.

I've been using a [Light & Motion Vis 360+](http://www.lightandmotion.com/choose-your-light/vis-360) for a couple years. Its a great light, offering 360 degree visibility and a nice beam wherever I happen to be looking. And its always with me, so I don't have to worry about removing it from my bike whenever I lock up.

The rear light easily zip-ties to the back of the Overtake. The front light, however, mounts by running a rubber strap through the vents present on normal bicycle helmets. The overtake lacks these pass-through vents due to the Koroyd. I didn't want to glue the light to the helmet, so I thought I'd try Velcro. I picked up some [industrial strength 2" wide tape](http://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Industrial-Strength-Wide-Black/dp/B00114LOMM/) and stuck the loop to the helmet and the hook to the back of the light. I wasn't sure if it would hold, but so far it seems to have worked out great. It hasn't fallen off and I have not noticed the light being wobbly while in use.

While I was it, I put a piece of loop on the back of the helmet and stuck a ranger eye on it.
