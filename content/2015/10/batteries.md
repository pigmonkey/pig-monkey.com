The [Pelican 1060](http://www.pelican.com/cases_detail/Case/1060/) plus [pre-cut foam from eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=pelican%201060%20battery%20foam&clk_rvr_id=914135050395&mfe=search) makes for compact and environmentally secure battery storage. The foam I bought has 10 holes for AAA batteries and 40 holes for CR123 and AA batteries. 
This holds the CR123 batteries I keep on hand to feed devices and all of my spare [AA/AAA Eneloops](/2011/09/sanyo-eneloop-rechargeable-batteries/).
