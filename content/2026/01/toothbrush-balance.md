Title: I brush my teeth while standing on one foot.

It takes about two minute to [brush your teeth](/2025/07/how-to-brush-teeth/). These two minutes are an opportunity to improve balance and ankle strength. Sometimes I switch feet halfway through, other times I'm feeling more ambitious and will balance on one foot in the morning and the other that night.
