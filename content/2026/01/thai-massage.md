Title: Better Living Through Getting Stomped

Four years ago I started going to a [Thai massage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Thai_massage) parlor.

This is the practice where they walk on your back, drive their elbows and the heel of their palms into you, and sometimes tie your limbs into knots. My findings are that the older and smaller the Thai lady, the more brutally she stomps on you. I spend much of the session attempting to practice the [Vipassana body sweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassana_movement#S._N._Goenka) technique under duress and trying not to vocalize the pain. It's great and I love it.

They would of course lessen the pressure if asked, but this is both incompatible with my male ego and would go against the teachings of the Bodhisattva in the incarnation known as Patrick Swayze.

If I were a rich man I would go monthly, but I am not, so I limit myself to three or four times per year. I consider this a component of my prana-bindu training.
