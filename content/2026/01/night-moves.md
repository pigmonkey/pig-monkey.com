After falling out of the habit for a few months, I resumed my [night runs](/2024/07/night-run/) at the end of December. I've been back into it for about a month now. It's great, speed-running [night city](https://vogelmusic.bandcamp.com/track/night-city), just me and the coyotes.

New to this cycle, I now stop at one of those outdoor fitness areas near the end of my run and knock out some pull-ups. (It turns out using a bar is in fact easier than my normal [finger pull-ups](/2025/07/pull-ups/).) There's usually a couple other weirdos there.
