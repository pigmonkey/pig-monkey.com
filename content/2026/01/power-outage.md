Two weeks ago I [lost power](https://sfstandard.com/2025/12/22/san-francisco-blackout-what-we-know-pge/) from about 14:00 till about 21:00. This had negligible impact on my day. I took out [my lamp](https://www.sofirnlight.com/products/sofirn-lt1-anduril-2-0-rechargeable-camping-lantern) and continued with the itinerary. My time was spent:

* Drinking tea<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:stove"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:stove" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>
* Lifting [Harambe](/2025/10/resistance-regime/)
* Reading [Flaubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_Education)
* Pursuing satori

It was just another Saturday afternoon.

> I told Sibylla & she asked what my teacher had said. I said he had said it was very good.

> Sibylla said that didn't sound very character-building. I said most authorities on child psychology said a child should be given encouragement and reinforcement. Sib said Bandura and who else? I said everybody else. I didn't say that the authorities also said a parent had to be able to set limits because I was afraid she might suddenly decide to make up for lost time and set a lot of limits.

> Sibylla said: Well just remember Richie, becoming the great judo champion is not the end of the story.
> 
> I said I didn't think I was the great judo champion just because I could beat Lee and Brian at Bermondsey Boys Junior Judo.
> 
> Sibylla said: It isn't a question of beating X and Y. What if there's no one you can't beat? It's a question of perfecting your skill and achieving satori. What on earth are they teaching you in this class?
> 
> I said we mainly concentrated on learning how to throw people to the ground. Sib said: Must I do *everything* myself? She was grinning from ear to ear.
