On Friday night I went to a screening of Chungking Express. On Sunday I went to a different theatre to see the new restoration of Seven Samurai. That's a pretty good weekend for film. It made me curious to see a list of the films I had watched in theatres over the past 12 months. I queried the `Expenses:Entertainment:Film` register of my [ledger](/tag/plaintextaccounting/) to put one together.

This is a pretty decent collection, and these past 12 months have not been unusual in that regard. I had the sense that I saw fewer new films in theatres, but that appears not to be the case. I think going to a revival screening of a film I already know is just more memorable as a theatrical experience. I enjoy living in a place with a robust culture of cinema, where I can go see some IMAX spectacle one weekend and a 35MM noir the next.
