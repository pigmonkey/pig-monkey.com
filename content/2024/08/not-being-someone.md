> To be no one, all things considered, is something of a privilege... How can anyone be so arrogant or so rash as to serve himself up as prey to a pack of strangers? Their names are dirtied in thousands of mouths; the curious rob them of their thoughts, their hearts, their lives. If I too were subjected to the cupidity of that ferocious mob of ragpickers, I would certainly end up by considering myself nothing but a pile of garbage. I congratulated myself for not being someone.

Simone de Beauvoir, [The Mandarins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandarins)
