Title: On Song Zhong

I bought a couple ounces of [Song Zhong](https://redblossomtea.com/products/song-zhong?variant=31628017156) the last time I found myself in Chinatown. Red Blossom recommends brewing it at 210°F. I did this for my first few sessions, and was not impressed with the tea. Then one day I accidentally brewed the Song Zhong at 190°F (I thought it was my old pal [MLX](/2022/10/mi-lan-xiang/) in [the gaiwan](/2022/11/titanium-gaiwan/)). That resulted in a much tastier liquor. I've been working through the rest of the leaves at that temperature.

I still only brew it for Red Blossom's recommended time of 30 seconds. Though sometimes I get distracted writing a blog post and don't decant it for 90 seconds. I'm not above drinking it. Life is full of sacrifice.
