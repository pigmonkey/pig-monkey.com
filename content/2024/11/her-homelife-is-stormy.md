In the [Tamara de Lempicka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_de_Lempicka) exhibit [at the de Young](https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/tamara-de-lempicka) there's a wall with a timeline of her life. The entry for 1923 reads:

> Her homelife is stormy; Tadeusz grows intolerant of his wife's affairs, cocaine use, late nights spent at clubs followed by valerian-induced sleep, and long work sessions listening to Richard Wagner at full volume.

A few years later they were divorced.

I prefer to interpret this as if he could have put up with the affairs, the coke, the clubbing and valerian, but the Wagner was just [a bridge too far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE03Lqm3nbI).

As someone who went to two performances of [Tristan und Isolde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde) this season, I'm not sure I concur with his assessment.
