Title: Hafny FR03 Jones Bar Mirror

I tried a few different mirrors on my [Jones Loop H-Bars](https://jonesbikes.com/loop-bar/).

The [D+D Oberlauda UltraLite Bike Mirror](https://ortliebusa.com/product/bike-mirror-10/) mounted underneath the bars just before the weld worked decently, but the mirror's clamp is annoying when you want to rest your hand on top of that part of the bar.

After further trials, I developed a preference for the [Hafny HF-M951B-FR03](https://www.hafnycomponents.com/fr03). This opinion is [shared by others](https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/reviews/board/message/?thread_id=789871).

The FR03 uses the same high quality glass and mount as [the FR06 model Hafny on my road bike](/2023/10/hafney-fr06/), but the two models have slight differences. The mirror of the FR03 is round, where the FR06 has a subtle teardrop shape. The bracket which connects the FR03 to the bar plug attaches to the edge of the mirror, where on the FR06 the bracket attaches in the center of the rear of the mirror. These differences make the FR03 better suited to flat bars, and the FR06 better suited to drop bars.

A bike with Jones bar is a wide load, and a bar-end mirror makes it even wider. I compensate for this by only having a left-side mirror, which gets the job done. I also keep the adjustment bolt loose enough that I can tilt the mirror into the bars if I'm squeezing through a narrow passage.
