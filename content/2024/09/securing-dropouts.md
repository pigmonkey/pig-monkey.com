Title: Securing Dropouts

When packing a bike for air travel or shipping, at least one wheel usually must be removed. This leaves the fork or rear dropout susceptible to damage if inward force is applied to the void where the hub of the removed wheel would usually be. Some sort of rigid spacer must be inserted into the axle space to prevent this. Rolled-up cardboard is a common disposable solution.

When searching to see if there was a better solution to this, I came across [a post on Bicycles Stack Exchange](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/a/93891):

> The best and cheapest way to protect your fork and rear drop out is to use a fully threaded bolt, four large washers and four butterfly nuts. A washer and butterfly nut goes inside on both sides and the same is attached on the outside of both sides. Tighten the two interior butterflies against the washers where they are snug and not pushing the frame/fork out past its limits. Then tighten the butterflies on the outside firmly inward, to immobilize the fork or rear dropout.

I thought this was a great idea, made even better by the fact that I use [Pitlock](https://www.pitlock.de/) security skewers on my bikes.

Pitlock skewers usually are just threaded on the business end, with the rest of the rod being smooth. But I recalled seeing that Pitlock also offered [fully threaded 240mm joker skewers](https://www.pitlock.de/en/addition/quick-release-axles-addition/240mm-achse-mit-durchgehendem-gewinde-universal.html). Switching to these allows me to implement the above solution with my normal skewer and Pitlock bits, with only the addition of two M5 fender washers and wing nuts (per wheel). That's only an additional 9 grams (per wheel) to add to my touring kit.

I used this solution on my recent Redoubt tour around Idaho and Montana. It worked great on both flights, despite TSA's comical attempt to repack the box after inspection on my return flight. The box I rescued from my local bike shop was long enough that I only had to remove the front wheel (and front fender and front rack), so I didn't have to use this trick on the rear dropouts. I still packed the two washers and wing nuts for the rear in case I found myself with a smaller box for the flight home. They're small enough and light enough that I don't mind packing them just-in-case.

I'm glad to have a permanent solution to this problem. So far I have only purchased a single pair of the fully threaded skewers for [my new touring bike](/2024/04/expanding-fleet/), but I'll probably buy a second pair to replace the normal Pitlock skewers on my road bike in case I ever decide to fly with that one.
