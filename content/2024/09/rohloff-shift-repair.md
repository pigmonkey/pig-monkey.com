Title: I had my first road-side repair on my Rohloff bike today.

While flying [down the side of Tamalpais via Eldridge](https://bayarearides.com/rides/mounttam1/) for the first time in a couple months I found myself wondering if that trail somehow managed to get even rockier. Once I regained the pavement at sea level I went to shift and my twist shifter just spun. Turns out I had rattled the shift box off the hub.

To be fair, I hadn't popped off the rear wheel or otherwise touched that bolt since before my recent tour, so it could have been working itself loose over the course of the two airplane flights and 700+ miles through the northwestern hinterlands, rather than just the ridiculous rocks of Eldridge, Indian Fire, Blithedale, et al.

It's easy enough reattach, though since I had moved the twist shiftier I had to [reset the gear selection](https://www.rohloff.de/en/service/handbook/speedhub/operation/wheel-installation#c21145). I think that's a pretty good reliability record for 7 months of riding. Maintenance has been minimal: I've swapped the brake pads, and I think I've lubed the chain twice. I think all the components are just about broken in now.
