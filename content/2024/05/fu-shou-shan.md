This year I've mostly been drinking [Fu Shou Shan](https://redblossomtea.com/products/fu-shou-shan-spring).

It is a Formosa oolong tea, on the lighter end of the oxidation spectrum, which gives it a creamy and buttery taste that is somewhat reminiscent of a green tea. In the way that [Snow Dragon blurs the boundary between green and white](/2023/10/snow-dragon/), Fu Shou Shan blurs the boundary between green and oolong. I seem to be going interstitial with my tea. Liminal, even.

I bought a little bit to try in January, and then in February braved the Lunar New Year crowds in Chinatown to procure a larger supply. I've been drinking it regularly since. Now that the weather is warming up, I will begin to bring the fruitier [Mi Lan Xiang](/2022/10/mi-lan-xiang/) back into rotation -- I'm especially looking forward to cold brew on hot days -- but Fu Shou Shan will stay on the menu.
