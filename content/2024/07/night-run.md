Title: Night Run

I began running at night last autumn. I referred to them as "night runs" but this phrase was mostly aspirational, as I would usually take off around 18:00, or shortly thereafter. But it was dark, and that was the point.

I found that I enjoyed running through the dark, sometimes through city streets, other times down wooded trails, solitary in my small [forcefield of light](https://www.zebralight.com/H600c-Mk-IV-18650-XHP502-4000K-High-CRI-Headlamp_p_235.html). I've seen all sorts of wildlife: raccoons, coyotes, Donald Trump's motorcade. I once ran by a guy valiantly attempting to blow on a didgeridoo while playing death metal on his phone.

This year, as the days lengthened, my late afternoon runs started to become light enough to not require a headlamp. That was no fun, so in the spring I rescheduled my runs to start around 21:30 -- sometimes as early as 21:00 if I'm heading up [Twin Peaks](https://macwright.com/2018/10/15/twin-peaks) and want to catch the metropolitan alpenglow. Now they are actually night runs.
