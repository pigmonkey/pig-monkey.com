Title: Elzetta Retention

As I have [previously mentioned](/2016/08/raven/), I started out using a [Prometheus Lights Titanium Pocket Clip](https://darksucks.com/products/surefire-titanium-clip) on the [Elzetta Alpha](/2019/08/elzetta-thoughts/) before switching to the now-discontinued Raven Pocket Clip in 2016. The O-ring provided by the Raven Pocket Clip is key to how I use the light. It allows me to release the light and use my hand for something else, without dropping the light. The clip itself is perfectly adequate, though not as tight and springy as the titanium clip.

Last summer, I decided to move back to the titanium clip, but to add my own O-ring. I basically knocked off what [Retention Ring](https://retentionring.com/) sells, just using spare bits I already had around. It consists of a little bit of [Lawson Ironwire](https://www.lawsonequipment.com/products/ironwire-high-strength-accessory-cord), an O-ring with 1" internal diameter, a tiny piece of heat shrink tubing, and a knot. It isn't pretty, but it has been working great as part of my EDC for the past 8 months.
