Title: The Forever Mop

I [like to spend time on my floor](/2023/12/floor-sitting/). This requires cleaning the floor. A [good vacuum](/2020/09/hepa-vacuum/) is part of the solution, but the floor must also be washed. This necessitates a mop.

I was not good about mopping for a long time. I could never find a mop that was both effective and pleasant to use. That changed 2 years ago when I bought the [Quick Loop](https://www.quick-loop.com/). I think it's great. It has turned me into a regular mopper.

The Quick Loop is based on the same idea as a [Cuban mop](https://www.remodelista.com/posts/cuban-mop-how-to-use/), but with the addition of a coiled steel spring that has two loops. The loops allow a towel to be quickly secured to the head, rather than just having the towel folded over a dowel, as in the Cuban option.

My floors are all either ceramic tile or Redwood. I primarily [load the Quick Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEDj6zZXYNE) with [automotive microfiber towels](https://www.chemicalguys.com/products/professional-grade-microfiber-towel-6-pack) that measure 16" x 24". Any towel of roughly those dimensions works fine. I use the microfiber towel dry, but spray the floor with [diluted Bronner's Sal Suds](/2019/07/cleaner/) and then mop that up.

I have yet to [tango with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAHO8oqf6Z4).
