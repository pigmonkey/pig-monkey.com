I have a rule that I am allowed to purchase certain goods whenever I both can afford to do so and think that I may possibly have a use for them. It is a small list, including items such as [Voile straps](https://www.voile.com/voile-straps.html), [Abloy Protec2 padlocks](https://securitysnobs.com/Padlocks/), and [Pelican cases](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/products/cases/). Even if the specific model I purchase ends up not working for whatever project I currently have in mind, I can always use more of these items, and will never regret the purchase<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:hemhaw"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:hemhaw" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>. In the parlance of our times, these items [spark joy](/2017/07/folding/).

Recently I determined that my [zibaldoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zibaldone) situation was getting out of hand. I had completed notebooks in two different locations, empty notebooks in three, and accoutrements like covers and inserts all over the place. "Self," I said to myself, "This situation will not stand." But it seemed like the perfect excuse to buy another Pelican case. I trawled eBay for a week until I found a good deal on a used [yellow 1450](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/protector/1450/?sku=1450-001-240). This now holds all notebooks, along with their directly related accessories. It sits on top of a cabinet next to my other 1450 (a previous eBay find). I figure I've got space for at least two more.
