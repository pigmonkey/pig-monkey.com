I had [They See Your Photos](https://theyseeyourphotos.com/) use the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) to analyze my most recent selfie.

> The foreground shows a man relaxing on a portable camping chair next to his touring bicycle. The bike is heavily laden with panniers suggesting a long journey. In the background, there is a dry, scrubby landscape with low-lying vegetation and sparse trees under a clear blue sky. The location appears to be a trail or roadside somewhere in a temperate climate. The overall setting suggests a sense of adventure and self-sufficiency.

> A Caucasian male, appearing to be in his 30s, of seemingly middle-class economic status, is seen taking a break, enjoying a drink from a thermos. He seems relaxed and content; possibly on a solo bikepacking trip. His attire suggests an outdoor lifestyle and active pursuits. His expression appears peaceful and reflective. The image appears to be taken with a professional camera during daytime.

> The man's sunglasses appear to be polarized, which might suggest he is protecting his eyes from glare on a bright sunny day. A small, almost invisible detail of a thin twig can be seen to the left of the bicycle tire. The overall setting suggests a planned stop during his journey, with equipment suggesting a well-prepared and experienced cyclist. The overall cleanliness of his equipment points to a tidy and organized individual.

It hallucinated panniers (the bike has a bar bag and saddle bag, not panniers -- get your luggage straight, Google). There is nothing heavy about my tea party load-out. I'm out for the afternoon. The thermos is on the ground; I'm drinking from a mug.

But I do like to think of myself as well-prepared, experienced, tidy, and organized. I'm glad the Machine sees me that way. [I feel seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixzUQPkaR-U).
