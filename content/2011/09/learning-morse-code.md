Although it's no longer required for the [amateur radio Technician license](/2010/10/studying-for-the-amateur-radio-technician-exam/), I have decided to learn [Morse code](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Morse_code). Despite it's age, Morse remains one of the most effective ways to transmit information over long distances using minimal infrastructure and power.

To begin, I have printed and laminated the code chart from [learnmorsecode.com](http://www.learnmorsecode.com/). This makes encoded and decoding Morse a simple (although not fast) task. I've also put a variety of audio files consisting of slow Morse transmission on my media player. With a notebook and pen, I can practice decoding the messages wherever I am.

I'm aiming for 10 minutes of practice per day.
