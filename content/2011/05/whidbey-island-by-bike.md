I've toured <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Whidbey_Island">Whidbey Island</a> before by bus, car and foot, but never by bicycle. I decided to remedy that today. It was forecast to be warm and sunny (only the third day of the year I can say that about), so I woke up early to make the 9:00 AM <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Washington_State_Ferries">ferry</a> sailing.

Whidbey is a pleasant mixture of forest and pastoral farmland. I decided to confine my explorations to the south end of the island, as that's the area I know least.

I logged about 45 miles in the saddle over a leisurely 6 hours, plus about 2 hours of breaks, including lunch in <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Langley,_Washington">Langley</a>.
