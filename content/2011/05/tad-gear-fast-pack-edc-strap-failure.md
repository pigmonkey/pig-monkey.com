Last week I noticed that the top right compression strap on my <a href="http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/">Triple Aught Design</a> FAST Pack EDC had begun to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5697160902/">rip off from the pack</a>. This is the first failure I've experienced on the pack, which has been in regular use since Fall 2007.

I'm surprised that it was this particular strap that failed first. I don't often carry heavy items in the Transporter Tail, so the strap does not have a lot of stress placed on it. Still, I feel better about sewing it back down than I would about repairing a load-bearing strap.

Now: A needle, a length of #69 nylon thread, and a bit of time.
