I reviewed the Kuiu Guide Gloves [on ITS Tactical](http://www.itstactical.com/gearcom/clothing/kuiu-guide-gloves-mountain-tested-mountain-approved/). Check it out. Or just go straight to Kuiu and [buy a pair](http://shop.kuiu.com/guide-glove-p17.aspx). They're that good.

> At 2.6 ounces (74 grams), the Guide Glove weighs only 0.3 ounces more than a pair of Mechanix Original Gloves of the same size -- an impressive feat, considering that the Guide Glove is made of much more substantial materials. In every way, the gloves have exceeded my expectations. They are more breathable, more water repellent, and provide a higher dexterity than I expected.
