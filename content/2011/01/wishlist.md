<a href="https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wishlist">Wishlist</a> is a Django application for creating wishlists.

I used Amazon Wishlist for a number of years, but my paranoia finally caught up to me and I decided that I didn't need to give Amazon that much more information about my interests.

I tried a few substitutes and found that my requirements for a wishlist were less than common. I don't often use wishlists in the usual way of asking people for gifts on special occasions. Instead, I use wishlists privately to keep track of items that I wish to purchase myself. It helps me to determine savings goals, to track books that I want to read, etc. As such, I usually do not want items on my wishlist to be publicly viewable.

Out of the substitutes I tried, <a href="http://www.wishlistr.com/">Wishlistr</a> was undoubtedly the best, but there were some aspects of it that I didn't like. After using it for a while, I decided to write my own app.

As with <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/12/24/gear-tracker/">Gear Tracker</a>, Wishlist is open source. <a href="https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wishlist">You can get the code on GitHub</a>.
