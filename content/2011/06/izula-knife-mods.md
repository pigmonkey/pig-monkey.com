About a month ago I gave my [Izula](http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/1/rat-izula-neck-knife/) a cosmetic make-over, inspired by [Widerstand](http://www.flickr.com/photos/angryface/)'s similar mods to his [Becker knives](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hIiZW7xmmE).

Originally the knife had a light tan powder coating on it, which protected the blade from rust and other wear, but did nothing for style. The first step I made in the modification process was to spend a couple hours with a piece of sandpaper, scraping off the coating until I was down to bare metal. That gave the knife a nice, raw look. But it also made it susceptible to rusting. The solution: a patina!

The [last time](http://pig-monkey.com/2009/04/7/patina/) I talked about patinas I achieved it with moldy potatoes and citrus fruit. This time around I went the easier route and dumped the Izula into a bowl of vinegar over night. I thought it looked great when it came out, and I was pleasantly surprised that I could still see the RAT logo and Izula ant. To finish off the coating I rubbed a little mustard on a few spots on either side of the blade.

The way the knife comes from the factory, the gimping is nice and rounded, providing a comfortable grip for the thumb. I almost never place my thumb on the back of the spine, so gimping doesn't do much for me. And because it was rounded, it couldn't throw any sparks off a [ferro rod](http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/6/simple-ferrocerium-rods/). To make the whole affair a bit more useful I took a Dremel tool and redid the gimping. It's much more rough and sharp now, less ideal for thumbs but great for throwing sparks.

After that all that was left was to re-wrap the handle with a new piece of paracord -- black this time -- and the job was done. My favorite EDC knife: even better than before.
