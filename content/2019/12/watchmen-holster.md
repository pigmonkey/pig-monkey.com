I fully expected the next frame to be this guy shooting himself in the leg, but the scene just ignores his sloppy trigger finger and complete disregard for safety.

Other than that scene, I've enjoyed the first couple episodes of [the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)) and its soundtrack so far.
