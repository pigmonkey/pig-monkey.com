Title: The Field Memo Pad

While I still believe in [the supremacy of the 4" x 6" Field Message Pad](/2012/11/field-message-pad/), there are times when something smaller is wanted. Perhaps you need something more pocketable, or you have little room in your bag, and you only need small sheets for incidental notes. For these situations I use the Field Memo Pad.

The Field Memo Pad is built around the [Mil-Spec Monkey Notebook Cover Plus](https://milspecmonkey.com/store/field-supplies/546-msm-notebook-cover-plus.html?search_query=notebook+cover&results=5). This holds 3" x 5" top-bound spiral notebooks, such as the [Rite in the Rain 935T](https://www.riteintherain.com/top-spiral-universal-tan-3x-5). These notebooks are large enough for incidental note taking, and slide easily into a pocket. "Slide" is perhaps not the correct word when the notebook cover is added. The cover is made of Hypalon, which is quite tacky. However this is a feature, not a bug. When you are seated or kneeling and using your leg as a writing surface, the tackiness prevents the pad from slipping around, which is actually quite useful.

The rear flap of the notebook slides into a pocket on the front of the cover. An identical pocket sits on the other side of the cover. I use this rear pocket to hold a few business cards and a [universal device reset tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_clip) (it's also a great place for your [Bogota Pi](/2018/11/bogota-pi/) picks). An elastic band across the bottom of the cover marks your current page, making it easy to flip to wherever you left off when opening the notebook. Two elastic bands on either side hold writing instruments. I most often use these to keep a [Fisher Space Pen 400B Bullet](https://www.spacepen.com/400B.aspx) with [clip](https://www.spacepen.com/blackbulletpenclip.aspx) and a [black Sharpie Mini](https://www.sharpie.com/markers/classic/mini/SHMiniAquaFine), though full-sized writing tools will also fit. The spiral binding of the notebook sits above the top of the cover, allowing the notebook to be opened and folded over completely.

The Field Memo Pad provides everything needed for an all-weather analog data dump, in a pocket friendly format.
