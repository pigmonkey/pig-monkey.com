Title: A Better Clipboard

One of the things I learned over the years at [2 Meter Critical Mass](/2019/12/2-meter-critical-mass/) and other radio events is the value of a good clipboard. The [Field Message Pad](/2012/11/field-message-pad/) or [Field Memo Pad](2019/12/field-memo-pad/) or even the [Field Notebook](/2010/05/diy-field-notebook-hack/) are great for my own notes, but when responding with a radio on behalf of an agency, said agency will probably have official log and message forms, and those forms will probably be on 8.5" x 11" paper. A clipboard is an important tool for making those forms usable in the field.

Many people end up with a [Gibson approved](https://twitter.com/GreatDismal/status/485250037694201856) [Saunders Storage Clipboard](https://saunders-usa.com/collections/aluminum-storage-clipboards). They're nice, but too bulky for my tastes. I use a [WhiteCoat Clipboard](https://mdpocket.com/Clipboards/whitecoat-clipboards-category).

These clipboards are hinged, allowing them to fold in half. They are intended to be folded so that they fit in the pocket of a lab coat and protect patient information from shoulder surfing. But when folded they also fit well into a decent sized cargo pocket, or larger jacket pockets. Folding the clipboard also provides some protection to the paper itself. Even if you're just putting it in a pack, it's nice to be able to fold the board and not worry about the paper becoming wrinkled.

The WhiteCoat Clipboard is available with different quick reference medical stickers. None of these are extremely useful to me. I went with the [EMT Edition](https://mdpocket.com/Clipboards/whitecoat-clipboards-category/whitecoat-clipboards-specialty/WhiteCoat-Clipboards-EMT-Clipboards/whitecoat-clipboard-blackout-EMT) because it has a scale for estimating pupil size, which is something I have struggled with in the past. I've considered printing my own stickers to put on the board -- perhaps with some kind of radio reference material -- but I haven't decided what information would be useful to include.

A [simple rubber band](https://mdpocket.com/Clipboards/Clipboard-accessories-category/Clipboard-Bands/whitecoat-clipboard-band) is available to secure the bottom edge of the paper. This is critical to one's sanity in windy conditions. A [pen clip](https://mdpocket.com/Clipboards/Clipboard-accessories-category/Pen-Clips/WhiteCoat-Pen-Clip) to keep your [Fisher Space Pen M4B](https://www.spacepen.com/M4Bnon-reflectivemilitarymatteblackcap-o-maticpen.aspx) close to hand completes the package.

The system is overpriced, but I am very happy with its functionality.
