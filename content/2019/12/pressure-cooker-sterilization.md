Sport bottles lids often have small nooks and crannies that are excellent for growing bacteria and difficult to clean by hand. I occasionally throw these lids into my pressure cooker with a steaming basket or trivet to sterilize them. [Multiple](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12267939/) [studies](https://azahec.uahs.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/u132/19-arnett_rhpp_pressure_cooker.pdf) [show](https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/adint.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/NewsArticles/Use_of_pressure_cookers_for_.pdf) that a standard pressure cooker can be an effective alternative to an autoclave in austere environments. The general rule of thumb seems to be about 15 psi for 15 minutes, though 30 minutes may be a safer bet for medical instruments.
