Title: I use urlwatch to monitor the global information super highway.

[urlwatch](https://github.com/thp/urlwatch/) is a simple program that monitors a list of URLs and sends an alert when it detects a change. It can be configured to only look for changes within certain HTML elements, or to grep for certain strings. I configure it to send me the changes via email. As with [RSS-Bridge](/2019/10/rss-bridge/), this tool is part of my strategy to liberate content from toxic silos and Make the Internet Great Againâ„¢.
