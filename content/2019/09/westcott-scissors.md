I carry the [Westcott Sewing Titanium Bonded Fine Cut Scissors, 2.5"](https://www.westcottbrand.com/products/scissors/titanium-bonded-scissors/westcott-sewing-titanium-bonded-fine-cut-scissors-2-5-13867-parent.html) everyday. Given the choice between a knife and a pair of scissors I'll choose the knife, but these scissors are small and light enough that I feel I can carry both.

Scissors offer some additional utility compared to a knife. They're useful for rounding the corners of medical tape to discourage peeling. They can clean up the area around a tear before repair with the [expedition sewing awl](/2018/12/expedition-sewing/). They can trim your nails. And they can go places a knife cannot. I've flown with these scissors in my carry-on. They are diminutive enough as to not frighten TSA agents.

I've tried carrying other scissors in the past. The popular [Slip-N-Snip Folding Scissors](https://www.slipnsnip.com/) (and the various knock-offs) are, I think, a piece of junk. They're too stiff, the scissoring is too rough, and the blades too thick. The [Nogent Folding Scissors](https://www.garrettwade.com/folding-scissors.html) look great, but are way beyond my price range. The Westcott scissors do not fold, but are still easily carried. Despite the product name, the overall length of the scissors is 3 inches. They weigh 5 grams (0.2 ounces). The blades are 1 inch long, agreeably sharp, pointy and thin. The scissors can disappear into a bag. I keep a small piece of heat shrink tubing over the blades of the scissors to prevent them from poking things. They get stored in my small EDC toiletry pouch.
