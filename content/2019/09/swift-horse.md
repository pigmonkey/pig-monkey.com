But otherwise I agree with the sentiment expressed by [Al-Mutanabbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mutanabbi) (translated by [Gertrude Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Bell)):

> The finest place in the world is the back of a swift horse,
> 
> And the best of good companions is a book.
