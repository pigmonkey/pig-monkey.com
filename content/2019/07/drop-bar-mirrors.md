Title: Mirrors on a bike are no different than mirrors on any other vehicle.

They aren't a replacement for turning your head, but they can be a useful supplement for maintaining 360 degrees of awareness.

I purchased a pair of [Sprintech Drop Bar Mirrors](https://www.amazon.com/Sprintech-Roadbike-Review-Mirrors-Pair/dp/B07CRJDHQD) last spring. I had never used a bike mirror before, but I've grown fond of these over the past three months of use. The viewport is small, but adequate to identify vehicles of any size. I keep the mirrors canted outboard slightly, which means they move if I lean the bike up against a wall. Sometimes I'll bump one when straddling the bike at a stop light. But they're easy to move back into place, and I've never had them move on their own -- rough roads aren't enough to rattle them -- so I don't mind this. Having never used any other kind of bike (or helmet) mounted mirror, I can't compare them against their competition, but I think [the Swiss](http://www.sprintech.eu/) are on to something with these. I'd buy them again.
