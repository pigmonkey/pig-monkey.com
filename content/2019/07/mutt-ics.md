More specifically, [Neomutt](https://neomutt.org/). [Mutt ICS](https://github.com/dmedvinsky/mutt-ics) is a python script which takes an [iCalendar file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) and outputs the contents in a human friendly format. I use it in [my mailcap](https://github.com/pigmonkey/dotfiles/blob/master/config/mutt/mailcap) so that I can see details of calendar attachments when reading email. It's a simple script that improves my email workflow.
