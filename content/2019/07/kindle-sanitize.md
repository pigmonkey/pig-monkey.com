Title: It should go without saying that I've sanitized my e-reader.

Trying to inject advertising into the reading experience is sick and sacrilegious. A privacy sticker from [N-O-D-E](https://n-o-d-e.net/) covers the logo on the back of my Kindle, while a piece of tape sanitizes the front. Between this and [my offline, DRM-free method of using the device](/2018/11/ebooks/), I enjoy the Kindle without the corporate mindshare.
