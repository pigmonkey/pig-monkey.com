My all-purpose cleaner consists of:

* 0.25 L water
* 0.25 L distilled white vinegar
* 20 mL [Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds](https://shop.drbronner.com/sal-suds-biodegradable-cleaner)

I use this to clean my dishes, my shower, every surface in my apartment, and every part of my bike except the chain. About the only things I can think of that don't get cleaned with this mixture are my body and my electronics. Previously I used a mixture of Bronner's castile soap and water for all of these things, but Sal Suds is better at cutting grease. This makes it preferable for kitchen (and bike) duty. I saw no reason to keep two cleaners around, so I phased out the castile soap mix.

I mix this in a recycled 0.5 L glass bottle with a neck that has standard 28-400 threading, allowing me to add [a sprayer](https://www.amazon.com/Stream-Sprayer-Replacement-Standard-Bottles/dp/B07119VJX9/). The half liter bottle lasts me roughly two weeks. A single batch costs me in the neighborhood of $0.25, meaning I spend somewhere around $6.50 per year to clean my things.

I go back and forth on the vinegar -- sometimes I skip it and use 0.5 L of water instead. I don't notice a difference in the cleaning performance, but I tend to use more of it when I skip the vinegar. Vinegar is [an effective bactericide](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/04/vinegar-can-help-home-cooks-battle-bacteria-on-leafy-greens/) and, [unlike with castile soap](http://www.lisabronner.com/a-word-of-caution-about-vinegar-and-castile-soap/), there's no harm in mixing it with the Sal Suds detergent, so I generally opt to put it in.

To measure the detergent I use an [OXO Mini Angled Measuring Cup](https://www.oxo.com/mini-cup-angled-measuring-cup.html), which has proved a useful thing to keep around.
