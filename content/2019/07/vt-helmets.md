The [CPSC](https://www.cpsc.gov/) standard is of limited practicality. It seeks only to test if a helmet can prevent a skull fracture from a direct impact on the top of the head. It was refreshing to find [Virginia Tech's helmet ratings](https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html), backed by a [test methodology](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/83760/Bicycle%20STAR%20Methodology.pdf) that actually seems to appropriately model reality. I was pleased to see that my [Smith Overtake](http://www.smithoptics.com/overtake) scored 4/5. The Overtake is four years old and still in fine shape, but whenever it comes time to replace it I'll use these ratings to make a purchase decision.
