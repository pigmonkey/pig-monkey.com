[OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/) is a tool that applies [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) to PDFs. It uses [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to perform the OCR, and [unpaper](https://github.com/Flameeyes/unpaper) to clean, deskew and optimize the input files. It outputs [PDF/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=PDF/A) files, optimized for long-term storage. This isn't a tool I use frequently, but it is one I greatly appreciate having when I need it. If you ever find yourself scanning or photographing documents, you want OCRmyPDF.
