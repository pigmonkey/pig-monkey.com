Title: Go Juice

I like food. I don't do diets. I cast a wary eye upon fasting. I don't subscribe to the idea of "cleansing" the body of "toxins". Despite all of this, the drink that is central to the [Master Cleanse fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Cleanse) is part of my fueling strategy. I learned of the Master Cleanse while attending [The Sean Kennedy School of Patrolling](http://www.rantmedia.ca/patrolling/) and I now use it as an [electrolyte](https://www.outsideonline.com/1924871/drink-maple-syrup-cyclists) [drink](https://www.acleanplate.com/maple-lemon-electrolyte-water/) when my body tells me I am running low.

The components of a single serving of Go Juice are:

* 1 oz lemon juice
* 1 oz maple syrup previously-known-as-grade-B<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:maple-syrup"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:maple-syrup" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>
* 14 oz water
* A dash of cayenne powder

I juice the lemon into a [wide mouth pint sized mason jar](https://www.freshpreserving.com/ball-wide-mouth-pint-16-oz.-glass-mason-jars-with-lids-and-bands-12-count-1033891VM.html) using a [Jarware Stainless Steel Juicer Lid](https://www.jarware.com/products/citrus-juicer-lid-wide-mouth-stainless-steel). If I have a small lemon I'll juice the whole thing. If I have a medium sized lemon I'll juice half. Either way, the amount of juice is confirmed via the gradations on the side of the mason jar. Next, using the gradations, I pour in an equal amount of maple syrup. The rest of the jar is then filled with water. I add a very small amount of capsicum -- enough to get a small kick, not enough so I really taste it. Finally I toss on a [leak-proof lid](https://www.freshpreserving.com/ball-one-piece-leak-proof-regular-mouth-storage-lids-6-pack-1440010812.html) and shake it around for a few seconds.

The result is delicious and the effect immediate. I cannot imagine that anything good would come of trying to fuel the body on maple syrup and lemon juice alone, but as an occasional, supplementary kick it is a tool worth considering.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li id="fn:maple-syrup"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:maple-syrup" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> A few years ago the cabal of maple syrup producers decided that assigning letter grades to the different types of maple syrup made it too simple to buy what you wanted. Instead they decided to confuse people by moving to wordy, subjective labels. The maple syrup I buy is now labelled "very dark, strong taste". But of course it still has a secondary sticker on it that loudly proclaims "Previously Grade B", because that's how people shop.</li>
