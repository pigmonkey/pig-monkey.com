Title: I eat a lot of salmon.

My go to recipe is from [Derek on Cast Iron](http://www.derekoncastiron.com/2009/02/recipe-pan-seared-salmon.html). The only requirements are fish, olive oil, salt, pepper, and cast iron. Sometimes I substitute butter for the olive oil. If I have bacon grease available I'll use that instead. The whole procedure takes about 10 minutes.

I consider a good piece of salmon and a sourdough baguette to be a complete meal. If the fish is less good, I'll peel the skin off, dump it on top of a bowl of [Single Shot Rice](/2018/12/rice/), mash it all together, and sprinkle furikake on top.
