Title: If you have a Snow Peak Trek Titanium Bowl, consider augmenting it with a lid from Four Dog Stove.

[The lid](https://fourdog.com/snow-peak-olicamp-titanium-lids/) costs about as much as [the bowl](https://snowpeak.com/products/trek-titanium-bowl-stw-003t) -- maybe more if you acquired the bowl on sale -- but it is a well made tool that turns my favorite bowl into an eminently practical pot that is equally useful at home or in the backcountry. Throw in a [pot lifter](https://www.briangreen.net/bbb/2011/07/diy-skeletonized-3-pot-lifter.html), a [cozy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWJhPp2Rdjc) and there's nothing you can't accomplish.

The bowl has a capacity of about 600 milliliters. My bowl and lid weigh in at a combined 82 grams (2.9 oz).
