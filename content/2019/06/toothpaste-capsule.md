Title: Toothpaste Capsule

When travelling, I store toothpaste in a 10 gram round pill container. I [bought mine from The Container Store](https://www.containerstore.com/s/round-pill-box/d?productId=10024522). Depending on the thickness of the toothpaste, I find that I can get 14-20 servings out of this volume of container. I brush my teeth twice per day, so this translates to 7-10 days of travel.

These containers probably wouldn't be leak-proof if they were used to store a liquid, but they are up to the challenge of securing a higher viscosity substance like toothpaste.

After using these for a while I bought [a set of 15 gram containers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FHT7GOQ/), thinking that this would allow me to carry a two week supply. They accomplish that, but the containers aren't as nice. They have fewer threads, which make me think it is possible for them to pop open in my bag (though I haven't experienced this), and their slightly greater height makes them a bit less convenient to pack. I stick with the smaller containers, which are an adequate volume for most of my travel.

I think these toothpaste capsules are superior to travel-sized toothpaste tubes. I can fill my container with whatever toothpaste I prefer, instead of being limited only to those toothpastes for which I can find the elusive travel-sized tube. When I run out, I can refill the container with whatever toothpaste is around, instead of wastefully disposing of a used tube and beginning the hunt for another travel-sized tube. The capsule is easy to fill, unlike [other options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITnT9P3JXok) for [repackaging](https://www.toothpaste2go.com/). And they don't take the time and forethought (and low-humidity environment) that is required for [Mike Clelland's toothpaste dots](https://www.itstactical.com/gearcom/load-bearing/trimming-weight-with-toothpaste-dots-for-lightweight-backpacking/).

After finding that these toothpaste capsules worked well for me, I began using an identical pill container to carry sunblock. Sunblock can be repackaged more easily than toothpaste into [mini dropper bottles](https://www.litesmith.com/mini-dropper-bottles/), but it's impossible to clean those bottles out after use. The pill containers are simple to empty and clean, and applying sunblock from them is just as easy as it is out of a dropper or squeeze bottle. Unfortunately the toothpaste capsule and sunblock capsule look identical in my bag. So now I have the habit of sniffing my toothpaste and sunblock before I use it to make sure that I don't brush my teeth with sunblock or rub toothpaste into my skin. I should probably label them.
