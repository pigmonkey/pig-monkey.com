[GOESImage](https://github.com/pigmonkey/goesimage) is a bash script which downloads the latest imagery from the [NOAA Geostationary Operational Environment Satellites](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php) and sets it as the desktop background via [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/). If you don't use feh, it should be easy to plug GOESImage into any desktop background control program.

I wrote GOESImage after using [himawaripy](https://github.com/boramalper/himawaripy/) for a few years, which is a program that provides imagery of the Asia-Pacific region from the [Himawari 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himawari_8) Japanese weather satellite. I like seeing the Earth, and I've found that real time imagery of my location is actually useful for identifying the approach of large-scale weather systems. NOAA's nighttime multispectral infrared coloring is pretty neat, too.
