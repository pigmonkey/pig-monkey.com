I started buzzing my hair in 2009 after six years of long hair.

In the first few years I went through a couple different pair of clippers. They were all cheap, consumer-level models that eventually crapped out. I tried [a model that had a shape which claimed to be more ergonomic for self-cutting](https://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Deluxe-Yourself-Haircut-Pieces/dp/B001GQ3GF8/), but it ended up offering no practical advantage.

At the start of 2015 I bit the bullet and purchased the [Oster Classic 76](https://www.amazon.com/OSTER-Classic-Universal-Clipper-76076010/dp/B00070E8LA/). I had heard great things about this brand and model since I first started looking at clippers, but couldn't justify the price until I had spent more than their worth on other clippers that failed. The Oster Classic 76 is built like a tank. Oster has been building electric clippers in the US since 1928, and it shows in their product. They also build their products to be serviceable. Unlike cheaper clippers, these can be stripped down to their individual parts and repaired.

As with any other pair of clippers [plastic comb sets](https://www.amazon.com/Oster-Professional-Specially-Designed-Clippers/dp/B001T0HHB0/) are available. But one of the things I appreciate about the Oster is that you can also purchase metal blades of the preferred length. I cut my hair to 3/8", so when I bought the clippers I also purchased the [76918-146 replacement blade](https://www.amazon.com/Oster-Professional-76918-146-Replacement-Power-Teq/dp/B00141JKH8/). I think this offers a better cut than a short blade with a plastic comb.

I've been using this setup for four and a half years and have no complaints. Given my limited and personal use, I expect it should last the rest of my life.
