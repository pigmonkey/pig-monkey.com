The difference in line width is negligible -- only noticeable when compared side-by-side -- but the [fine cartridge](https://www.spacepen.com/blackfinepointspacepenpressurizedrefill.aspx) writes more smoothly and avoids the build-up at the tip that often occurs when the [medium cartridge](https://www.spacepen.com/blackmediumpointspacepenpressurizedrefill.aspx) is unused for some time.
