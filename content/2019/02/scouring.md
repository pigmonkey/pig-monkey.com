Back in 2013 [Brian Green published a review](https://www.briangreen.net/bbb/2013/11/trekr-ultralight-washcloth-by-lunatec.html) of the [Lunatec Trekr washcloth](http://lunatecgear.com/gear/trekr-self-cleaning-washcloths/). My showers haven't been the same since.

The Trekr is a simple nylon scouring cloth, measuring 11" x 11", with an elastic loop for hanging. It's the same material as a synthetic loofah, but being a flat cloth it doesn't hold moisture. At the time Brian posted the review I was on a campaign to eliminate sponges and sponge-like things from my life. Any cleaning tool in the bathroom or kitchen that holds water becomes [a Petri dish for bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC263056/), in humid areas especially so. I bought the Trekr to try at home, and it immediately earned a spot in my daily ablutions.

Lunatec's marketing campaign for the Trekr revolves heavily around the cloth being "self-cleaning", which just means that the material doesn't absorb anything, dries quickly, and every time you use it you are cleaning it with soap and water. I think this claim is accurate, though I still throw them into the [laundry](/2018/12/laundry-alternative/) every couple weeks, more as impetus to rotate the cloths than out of the need to clean them.

Shortly after acquiring the Trekr I learned that it was just a smaller take on the [Salux](https://saluxshop.com/) cloth. Hailing from Nippon, the Salux is exactly the same material as the Trekr, but measures in at a longer 33" x 11". The larger size makes it easy to scour your back, as demonstrated by the naked lady on their packaging.

I now own about half a dozen of the Salux cloths for use at home, and the same number of Trekr cloths. I throw a Trekr cloth in my bag whenever I'm showering away from home -- travel, backpacking, at the gym, or after [the axolotl tanks](/2018/04/axolotl/).

To use either the Trekr or Salux, I wet the cloth, give it a few gentle swipes across [a bar of soap](https://shop.drbronner.com/castile-bar-soap) (it also works fine with [liquid soap](https://shop.drbronner.com/pure-castile-liquid-soap)), and then start scrubbing from head to toes. The cloth lathers, cleanses, and exfoliates dead skin -- which, as we [learned from Gattaca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bgo-KrwdAw) is key to leading a successful life in our future eugenic utopia.

I have also tried the [Lunatec Scrubr dishcloth](http://lunatecgear.com/gear/scrubr-odor-free-dishcloths/), which is made of a thicker and more abrasive nylon. It is less exciting. I'll occasionally use it to scrub a surface clean at home, but for backcountry dish cleaning [the spatula reigns supreme](/2010/09/the-vagabonds-spatula/).
