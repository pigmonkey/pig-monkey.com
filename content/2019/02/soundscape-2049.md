Title: The score to Blade Runner 2049 failed to live up to the original, and is the only thing that prevented me from scoring the film 10/10.

But as [an ambient soundscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY6Jot9FwV8), it excels. The soundscape creator [wrote about his experience](https://ryanmatejka.blogspot.com/2018/08/why-and-how-i-created-another-blade.html) cutting, slowing, and mixing the score. I keep [a copy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Wdxag74G2IczleObBWxL1A1JbL_smuB) of his audio on my phone and play it whenever I need white noise -- concentration, mediation, sleep. It proved excellent on an airplane a couple weeks ago.
