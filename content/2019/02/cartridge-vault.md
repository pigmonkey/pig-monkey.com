I keep half a dozen of the [aforementioned fine Fisher cartridges](/2019/02/fisher-fine/) (black, red, and blue), as well as a [Parker Ballpoint Refill](http://www.parkerpen.com/en-US/ball-point-refill) and a [Parker Gel Refill](http://www.parkerpen.com/en-US/shop-online/quink-refill-ink-for-gel-pen-in-black-1950362--1) in a standard [CellVault](https://thyrm.com/product/cell-vault-battery-storage/). Keeping small, infrequently used items like that organized is key for future sanity.
