Title: Bruce Sterling is at his best when speaking.

I've always found [his novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling_bibliography#Novels) to be underwhelming, but I'll listen to anything he has to say. When speaking, the lens of his cultural critique is combined with dry wit, a rambling Texan drawl, and a faint sense of bemusement at the weirdness of the world and his place in it. [The Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/) recently released a recording of his talk at [The Interval](https://theinterval.org/), [How to Be Futuristic](https://theinterval.org/salon-talks/02018/oct/16/how-be-futuristic-bruce-sterling), which should probably be retitled How to Be Bruce Sterling.

One of my favorite talks by Sterling is [The Body in the Virtual World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSINgf_UBS8). Recorded in 1994, he was fresh off [The Hacker Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker_Crackdown), completing [Heavy Weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Weather_(Sterling_novel)), and at peak cyber-punk.
