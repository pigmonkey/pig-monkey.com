Title: Residual Oil Remover

Late last year I ran out of lens cleaner. In the past I've never made an informed purchase of lens cleaner, opting instead for the free bottles given out at optometry offices or whatever generic bottles were presented on the counter of the closest drug store. This time around I thought I'd look to see if there was any specific product worth purchasing. I assumed that there were probably picky photographers who had performed a survey of cleaners for their camera lenses, and that their conclusions would apply to other optical surfaces.

Surprisingly, I found only one useful review: [a 2013 post on on the Digital Photography Review Forum](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3690943), which outlined a testing method for cleaning solutions and concluded:

> Three branded cleaners out of about a dozen, after 5 test repetitions, walked away with the honors. They are: Zeiss Lens Cleaning Solution, Nikon Lens Cleaning solution and ROR Lens Cleaning Solution. At the bottom of the list was surprisingly, Purosol, that tied with straight distilled water for having absolutely zero emulsifying properties for removing skin oil in all 5 of our test repetitions. When I spoke with the Purosol folks, and asked "How does NASA use your product and for what cleaning purposes", I was politely told, "That information is classified, and, we unfortunately don't know!"

Between the 3 top reviewed products, I flipped a coin and ended up purchasing [ROR](http://www.ror.net/), or Residual Oil Remover.

ROR certainly works. I use it on my [Rudy lenses](/2018/11/laser-red/), my laptop screen and external monitors, as well as the screen of my phone. But because I made the purchase after I was out of my previous cleaner, I wasn't able to compare it to anything else for a couple months. Later on I found a partially used bottle of generic lens cleaner from my optometrist and was able to do a comparison. ROR cleans better with less rubbing.

I don't know what the contents were of that last bottle of generic cleaner, or how it compares to the other cheap, generic cleaners that I've used in the past. But I am happy enough with ROR that I will continue to use and recommend it. I have three bottles stashed around my frequented areas at home and work, and appreciate its ability to keep the clarity of my optical devices at a maximum.
