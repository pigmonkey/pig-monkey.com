Title: This time of year it is traditional for me to treat my saddle.

While the weather is still warm and pleasant here in Baghdad by the Bay, the hot sun and ass sweat of summer is fading into the past, and The Great Wet is on the horizon. Tonight I took my saddle to the sink and rinsed it off with some [Dr. B](https://shop.drbronner.com/pure-castile-liquid-soap#scent=Baby%20Unscented). I don't wash it every year, but it looked like it wanted it. After drying, I treat it to a sensual massage with a healthy helping of [Obenauf's LP](https://www.obenaufs.com/heavy-duty-lp-p/leather-preservative-paste.htm). Obenauf's products have served me and my leather well [for a while now](/2009/03/leather-boot-care/), and it's a nice treat [for my skin](/2009/09/obenaufs-skin-care/). The saddle will take a couple of coatings tonight. In the morning I'll wipe off the top, and then give it an ass polishing with the day's riding.
