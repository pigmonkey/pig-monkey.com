Title: Last year I bought a set of Orfos Pro lights.

The [Orfos Pro](https://www.orfos.us/pages/pro) is a simple and flexible LED light that is powered by a separate USB battery. I use the white light model as my bike headlight. This means that, when not in use, the light has a male USB Type-A plug hanging off the bike. In inclement conditions I usually want light, so I'll have the connector inserted into a battery. I haven't been too worried about protecting the plug when not in use. Over the past 14 months I haven't noticed any problems. But when I saw the [CozyCaps USB Caps](https://cozy-industries.com/collections/shop/products/cozycaps-2-pack) I decided they would be a worthwhile addition to the setup. I expect they will do a good job of protecting the connectors from dirt or light moisture.

I power the headlight with an [Anker PowerCore 5000](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-5000/A1109011), which mounts to the down tube via a [Twofish Bikeblock](http://www.twofish.biz/bike.html).
