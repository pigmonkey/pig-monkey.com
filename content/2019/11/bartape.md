A few weeks ago I installed a new set of handlebars. My old tape was cut too short for the new bars, so I had to replace it. I used the old tape to improve the grip and padding of a hammer, [chain whip](https://www.parktool.com/product/sprocket-remover-chain-whip-sr-1), and [breacher bar](https://countycomm.com/products/eod-robotics-breacher-bar).
