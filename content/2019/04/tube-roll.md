I carry a spare tube underneath my saddle.

With my [Schwalbe Marathon Supreme](https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tour-reader/marathon-supreme.html) tires I rarely get flats. When I do, I usually prefer to use [a patch](https://www.parktool.com/product/super-patch-kit-gp-2), but sometimes you need to replace the tube. To protect the spare tube from the elements -- UV rays, abrasion from dirt, etc -- I wrap it like a burrito in a piece of black Tyvek. This is then stuffed underneath my [Brooks B17](https://www.brooksengland.com/en_us/b17-family) and secured to the rails with a [12" nylon buckle Voile Strap](https://www.voile.com/voile-straps-12-inch-nylon-buckle.html).

The package is easy to get to when I need it, doesn't move until then, and isn't very visible unless you're looking at it. When I moved the spare tube from my pack to my bike, I wanted to avoid a noticeable bag like my [Revelate Jerry Can](https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/cockpit/Jerrycan). I've yet to have anyone steal this setup, but if they do, I'm only out $5 for the Voile strap, $8 for the tube, and a few pennies for the Tyvek. I can live with that.

In the case of a tire blow out, I've wondered if a piece of the Tyvek could be cut, folded, and used as an emergency boot [like a dollar bill](https://cyclingskills.blogspot.com/2008/07/dollar-bill-trick.html). I have not had the opportunity to test this, because [I buy good tires](/2018/11/marathon-supremes/) that don't blow out. The [repair kit I carry in my bag](/2018/04/screw/) also contains a couple actual [reifenflicken](https://www.parktool.com/product/emergency-tire-boot-tb-2), more so because carrying them increases the opportunities that I have to say *reifenflicken* than because I feel I actually need them.
