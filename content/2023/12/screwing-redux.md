Since [I outlined it in 2018](/2018/04/screw/), my EDC tool kit has not changed much. It is still based around the same titanium [Fix It Sticks](https://fixitsticks.com/), and intended primarily as a vehicular repair kit.

It is still carried in the same cuben fiber packing cube from Mountain Laurel Designs (since discontinued and replaced by the otherwise equivalent [Ultra X 100 Packing Cubes](https://mountainlaureldesigns.com/product/cuben-fiber-packing-cubes/)), though said cube is much worse for wear. Some of the smaller bits have poked a couple holes in the bottom of the pouch. I've patched this with [Tenacious Tape](https://www.gearaid.com/products/tenacious-tape-repair) on both the inside and the outside.

The bit selection has been augmented slightly. Installed in the Fix It Sticks are my most frequently used 1/4" drive bits.

* Torx T20s
* Torx T25s
* Phillips #2
* Hex 4mm

In the bit holder, I carry additional 1/4" drive bits.

* Hex 1.5mm
* Hex 2mm
* Hex 2.5mm
* Hex 3mm
* Hex 5mm
* Hex 5mm x 50mm
* Hex 6mm
* Hex 8mm
* Torx T8s
* Phillips #0
* Slotted 0.6mm x 4.5mm
* 4mm MicroBit Adapter, holding a slotted 0.25mm x 1.5mm

Keen eyed readers will notice two 5mm hex bits. The longer, 50mm bit is needed to reach into my [Gevenalle CX Shifters](/2022/10/gevenalle-cx/) to adjust the mounting bolt. This longer bit can also be used to provide a turning tool to be used with my [Pitlock](https://www.pitlock.de/en) key. (In 2018 I discussed using the longer Torx T25 bit for this. I now carry a standard length T25s, since I need the longer 5mm hex for the shifters.) My rear [Phil Wood Touring Hub](https://phil-wood-co.myshopify.com/collections/track-hub-parts/products/rear-11-speed-touring-hub-135mm-spacing-shimano-compatible-classic-model) takes two 5mm wrenches to remove the end caps. Doing this allows the cassette to be removed from the wheel, providing easy access to repair a broken drive-side spoke without messing around with [cassette removal tools](http://pardo.net/bike/pic/fail-029/index.html).

[Mini Knipex Cobra Pliers](/2021/08/knipex-8700100/) are only used infrequently, but are so useful when I do need them that I put up with their extra weight in the kit.

The Fix It Sticks [tire levels](https://store.fixitsticks.com/products/replaceable-edition-tire-lever) and [chain breaker](https://store.fixitsticks.com/products/chain-breaker) still live in the kit, though I have been debating removing the chain breaker. It is compact but heavy, and it has been about 15 years since I last had an incident that required a chain breaker on the road. It would definitely be in the kit for any multi-day trips.

My Pitlock key is on a [Flex-o-loc](https://luckyline.com/products/flex-o-loc/) key ring. The ring also holds a spare [KMC CL559R Missing Link](https://www.kmcchain.com/en/product/connector-missing-link-cl559r-10-speed), a [Maratac Titanium Peanut Lighter](https://countycomm.com/products/titanium-lighters-by-maratac?variant=27419356678), and a [CountyComm Titanium Piccolo Capsule](https://countycomm.com/products/tiny-ti-key-chain-dimpled-capsule) that holds two small security bolts.

A small cuben fiber zip pouch holds my [patch kit](/2019/10/patch/) and one [FiberFix](https://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fiberfix.php), including that little spoke wrench that comes with the FiberFix (annoying to use, yes, but agreeably small and light).
