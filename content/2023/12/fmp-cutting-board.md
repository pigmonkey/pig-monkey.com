Title: The FMP Cutting Board

I [previously mentioned](/2023/11/fmp-loadout/) that I install Rhodia pads in my [Field Message Pad](/2012/11/field-message-pad/) backwards, such that the thick cardboard backing is on top. This way when I open the pad, the cardboard provides a surface for writing on the back of the pages, where otherwise I would be writing on top of the FMP cover's tool slots and the stuff carried within them. This means the other side of the pad has a less firm backing. On a fresh pad this is not an issue, but can become one as pages are consumed and the thickness of the stack of remaining pages is reduced.

My latest innovation in Field Message Pad technology is the addition of a cutting board.

I keep a number of thin [HDPE cutting boards](https://www.amazon.com/Commercial-Grade-Cutting-Board-Mat/dp/B07B89H929/) on hand at home. I don't use these in the kitchen, where I care about my knives, but as project mats. If I'm gluing something, or cutting material with a utility knife, I'll throw one of these mats down to protect the work surface.

I traced a 4x6" square out on one of these, cut it out with a utility knife, and gave the 4 corners a few passes with a file. The resulting piece slides down the back slot of the FMP cover, behind the notebook. With this underneath, and the Rhodia's cardboard backing on top, I have a firm writing surface from the first page of the notebook to the last, on both sides of the page.

Being able to take notes on a stable surface while standing up, with the FMP in one hand and a pen in the other, feels like a super power.

Also, I always have an A6-sized cutting board with me now. Perhaps for impromptu charcuterie.
