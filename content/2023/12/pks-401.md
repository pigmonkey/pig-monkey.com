Title: I use spice jars to store tea at work.

The [Progressive Prepworks PKS-410 Spice ProKeeper](https://shop.progressiveintl.com/spices-seasoning-prokeeper-set/) come with a shaker screen, but that's easy to pop out, leaving you with a nicely sized container with a good lid and a decent seal. Tea usually should be stored in an opaque container, but since these are kept in my desk drawer, I'm not too concerned about light.
