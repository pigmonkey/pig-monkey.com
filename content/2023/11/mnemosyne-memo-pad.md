The [Field Message Pad](/2012/11/field-message-pad/) remains my primary writing setup. One of its strengths is the ability to switch between pads from Rite in the Rain and Rhodia.

The [Field Memo Pad](/2019/12/field-memo-pad/) is a useful substitute for quick and short notes. I have multiple, which I keep stashed in different places and bags. But its weakness is that it is dependent upon the Rite in the Rain pad. When not outdoors, I like having the option of switching to normal (fountain pen friendly) paper.

I recently discovered the [Maruman Mnemosyne N192A Twin Ring Memo Pad](https://www.jetpens.com/Maruman-Mnemosyne-N192A-Twin-Ring-Memo-Pad-Modified-B7-5-mm-Lined/pd/11412). They label this as [B7](https://papersizes.io/b/b7), which [ISO 216](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216) defines as 3.5 x 4.9 inches. But in fact the N129A does not meet the standard. It is instead 3 x 5 inches. This is identical to the [Rite in the Rain 135](https://www.riteintherain.com/3x5-top-spiral-notebook), making it a perfect substitute in this kit.

The paper in the N129A is lined, rather than graphed. This is unfortunate, but for my application I'm willing to overlook this imperfection.

In one of my kits I dropped a magnet down the back pocket. This pad now lives on my refrigerator, perfect for grocery lists and other kitchen related notes.
