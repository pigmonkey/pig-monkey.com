Title: My drive-side chainstay is cord wrapped.

I use the reflective Ironwire that [Lawson](https://www.lawsonequipment.com/products/ironwire-high-strength-accessory-cord) makes for [Durston](https://durstongear.com/products/lawson-reflective-dyneema-ironwire), tied in a [spiral French hitching wrap](https://www.paracordplanet.com/spiral-paracord-steering-wheel-wrap/). It helps to protect the chainstay, but mostly it looks cool.

At 2mm, Ironwire is slightly thicker than the 1.7mm Kevlar cord that ships with the [FiberFix Replacement Spoke](https://www.peterwhitecycles.com/fiberfix.php), but my guess is that I could unwrap some of this cord and use it with the FiberFix hardware. I have yet to break a spoke this eyar, so I haven't had an opportunity to test this.
