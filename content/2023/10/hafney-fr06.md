Title: Hafney FR-06 Mirrors

Last May I lost my right-side [Sprintech Drop Bar Mirror](/2019/07/drop-bar-mirrors/) in the baggage car of the [Amtrak Coast Starlight](https://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train). The right-side mirror is less useful than the left-side, so I didn't bother about a replacement until after pedaling the 1,200 miles back home.

Upon returning, I decided to explore what other mirror options there may be rather than immediately purchasing another Sprintech mirror. I rode with a [Take A Look Helmet Mirror](https://takealookactive.com/product/original-mirror/) for a few weeks, but found it to be less convenient than a mirror mounted to the bike. I messed with the [D+D Oberlauda UltraLite Bike Mirror](https://www.rei.com/product/188637/dd-oberlauda-ultralite-bike-mirror) for a couple days. It's a nice mirror, but I couldn't find a mounting position that I was happy with on my drop bars. (While messing with this mirror I ended up moving [my bell](/2022/02/ding-ding/) from the left to the right side.) Finally I purchased an [FR06](https://www.amazon.com/Hafny-Mirror-Shatter-Proof-Convex-Automotive/dp/B07WHMVLVS) from [Hafny Components](https://www.hafnycomponents.com/). I was immediately smitten with this, and bought a second FR06 for the other side a few days later.

The Hafny FR06 uses actual glass for the mirror. It is slightly convex -- though less so than the Sprintech -- and has a blue tint that does a great job of cutting back on glare. The optical clarity of the mirror is really excellent. This is entirely unnecessary for the application, but once I used it I didn't want to go back to Sprintech's chrome-coated ABS plastic.

The FR06 fits snugly into my [Rene Herse Rando Handlebars](https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/handlebars/randonneur-31-8-handlebars/), even with the tail of my [leather tape](/2022/11/adarga-tape/) tucked in. After inserting, a bolt is tightened to expand the assembly, locking it into place. The mirror itself is attached to the mounting assembly via a ball and socket joint. A separate bolt allows this joint to be locked in place. Since the mounting assembly can be rotated in addition to the pan-and-tilt of the mirror joint, positioning everything takes a little trial and error. Once the correct position is found, everything can be tightened down enough such that a smart smack will not cause anything to budge. Or it can be left loose enough to allow for in-flight adjustments. I've switched between both approaches, and in neither case have I had any issue with visual clarity or the mirror moving of its own accord, even on rough gravel roads.

I mount the FR06 with the logo-side of the assembly facing down. I think this is considered to be upside down, but it allows me to tilt the mirror up a few degrees higher than I otherwise could, providing a better picture of what's behind me above the actual road surface. With the logo on the assembly facing up I found that the mirror ran into the top of the assembly just 1 or 2 degrees shy of where I wanted it.

The shape of the FR06 mirror is different than the old Sprintech. I don't find the shape of one to be superior to the other. Both provide me with the image I want to see at a quick glance. But the higher quality look and feel of the Hafney offering makes me happy, and I think contributes to the overall sex appeal of my ride. This is something I prioritize.
