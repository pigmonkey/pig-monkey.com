Title: Snow Dragon

My go-to Chinese green tea is [Red Blossom's Pre-Rain Dragonwell](https://redblossomtea.com/products/prerain-dragonwell). I usually keep a supply of this stashed in one of my [Airscape canisters](/2022/11/airscape-tea-storage/). A couple weeks ago I saw that I was running low, and so saddled up to ride over to Red Blossom for resupply. (The guy who typically works weekends now recognizes me and no longer needs to ask my name to pull up my account which makes me feel like I spend entirely too much money there.)

Instead of coming back with more Dragonwell, I ended up with a couple ounces of [Snow Dragon](https://redblossomtea.com/products/snow-dragon). They describe this as combining "an heirloom white tea cultivar with a traditional green tea crafting style for an entirely unique taste, reminding us of a less vegetal and slightly creamier-tasting Dragonwell." I have found this description to be apt. Typically I do not truck with white tea, but this white-tea-crafted-as-a-green-tea is quite good. I think I still prefer Dragonwell as my regular green tea, but I plan to pick up more of the Snow Dragon to keep things interesting.

Meanwhile, I have run out of genmaicha, so this weekend I will be paying a visit to the ladies at [Chato](https://www.sfchato.com/). One must keep the tea larder stocked while on the path to satori.
