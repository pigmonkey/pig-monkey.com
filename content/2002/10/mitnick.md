I just finished read The Fugitive Game by Jon Littman tonight. It's a very good read and I'd recommend it to anybody interested in Kevin Mitnick, computing history, or hacking in general. It really does a great job of seperating fact from fiction and dismissing all the media hype that followed the case. To go along with the book, I decided to order 2600's movie Freedom Downtime for $20. I think that'll be interesting.<br />

Oh! Has anybody else heard the latest edition of Off the Hook (Oct. 16th, I believe)? It was a 2 hour special featuring Mitnick. Go. Download. Now.
