Slug: php

Some of you may notice that you are now viewing home.<i>php</i>! No more .htm! *Gasp!*<br />
This is because that old javascript randomizer I had for the upper banner was about as random as <a href="http://iceadvanced.net">jacob</a> is done with his site (not very) so, I replaced it with a php script (hence the .php extension)! Now, why php can generate a random number 1-9 better than javascript can, don't ask me but the .php extension will also lead us to greater and...better stuff.<br />
<br />
To celebrate the phpness of the site, I've added two new banners for a grand total of nine. See if you can guess what they are (not hard).<br />
<br />
Oh, and merry Halloween.
