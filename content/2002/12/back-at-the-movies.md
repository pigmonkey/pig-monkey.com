Do not go see Gangs of New York. It has to be one of the worst movies I've seen this year.<br />
<br />
Speaking of movies, has anybody seen the special extended edition of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD? I gave it to my dad for Christmas and we watched all 4 discs that day. They say it's only 8 hours, but I think it was 10. Anyway, the first two discs (the actual movie) are awesome. You get 30 minutes of deleted scenes.<br />

Coming home from Gangs of New York last night, I stopped at my bank and discovered a wireless network their. Interesting...<br />
