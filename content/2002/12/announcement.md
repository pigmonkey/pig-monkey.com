This is as good of time as any to make the official announcement on v4.5, no? Yup, it's in the works.<br />
<br />
There's no planned release date but I'd hope to see it out no later than the end of February. All I'll say about it right now is that the design will be...similar. Most changes will be elsewhere.<br />
<br />
And, if all goes to plan, the new phorum system will be up before the end of the year. If all <i>doesn't</i> go to plan, my goal will be to get it up before the next round of NukeZone starts.
