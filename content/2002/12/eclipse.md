Well, the eclipse is over (actually, its still going on but we decided we would watch the rest in the movie that'll be sent out to subscribers only). I broke out the ol' s-video cable and hooked the computer up to the TV so we could have the big screen and comfy seats. It was pretty cool and I captured 3 shots for you guys: <span class="removed_link">here</span>, <span class="removed_link">here</span> and <span class="removed_link">here</span>. Those three are in succession and are the best shots of the actual eclipse part. Oh, and <span class="removed_link">here</span> is a final one taken just seconds before this post.<br />

As mentioned before, I will be getting a movie of the whole thing and, depending on file size, I might upload it in January.
