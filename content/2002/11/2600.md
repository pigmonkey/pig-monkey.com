The latest issue (19:3) of 2600 came in the mail yesterday along with <a href="http://www.freedomdowntime.com/" >Freedom Downtime</a>. The movie is <i>really</i> good but I must say that I recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316528692/qid=1036818338/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-8917274-8224857?v=glance&s=books" >The Fugitive Game</a> first.<br />
<br />
If you have seen the movie Takedown, then there is no excuse for not watching Freedom Downtime to see the truth about the 91 minutes and 42 seconds or crap you sat through.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on the back of Freedom Downtime, there's a message that says "free and unaltered broadcasting, netcasting, and copying are encourage". So I might rip it.
