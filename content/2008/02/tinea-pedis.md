The week before last, I had a fungal infection on my left foot, marking the first time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete%27s_foot">athlete's foot</a> has paid me a visit-- I'm usually rather good about wearing shoes in public places, sandals in public showers, et cetera. But the combination of barefoot martial arts and wearing socks most all the time (it's cold! remember, <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/11/30/acclimatize/">I don't use heating</a>) -- particularly soon after I get out of the shower -- gave the fungi a hospitable environment in which to grow.

I noticed it early as an itch on the foot, which was unusual and so warranted research. Google told me that this could be the sign of an infection, so my first thought was to rub Tea Tree Oil over the base of the foot and between the toes. I did this after a shower every day, but after 3 days the foot had begun to look worse. So, I performed further research: what athlete's foot was, how it grew, and possible remedies. This led to me devising the following schedule (note that I shower in the evenings):

<ul>
<li>Morning:
   <ul>
      <li>Upon waking, rub the foot with rubbing alcohol (70% isopropyl), which is both cleansing and drying.</li>
      <li>Before leaving for the day, rub the foot with Tea Tree Oil, an anti-septic.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Afternoon:
   <ul>
      <li>Soak in a garlic bath for 30 minutes, then towel dry.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Evening:
  <ul>
      <li>After shower, powder the foot with Baking Soda.</li>
      <li>Before bed, rub the foot with Tea Tree Oil.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>

Observing this schedule, the infection cleared up in 5 days.

Luckily, the temperatures have been rising lately, so I was also able to stop wearing socks whenever home. This gives my feet ample time to dry after the shower, and all night to breathe.

The garlic bath is made by crushing 4 garlic cloves and placing them in a large pot of warm water, with a splash of rubbing alcohol added. It's quite pleasant, though not recommended for members of the undead.
