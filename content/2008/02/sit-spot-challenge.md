A <a href="http://www.wildernessawareness.org/home_study/30day_challenge.html#spot">sit spot</a> is an important part of Wilderness Awareness School's <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/04/01/kamana-one/">Kamana</a> program. Today, the School <a href="http://www.wildernessawareness.org/home_study/30day_challenge.html">announced a challenge</a> to visit a sit spot, 20 minutes a day, for 30 days:

<blockquote>The Sit Spot (also known as the Secret Spot): a surefire way to get to know nature and yourself more intimately... For some of us, going to this place is easy, like breathing. For others, we really want to visit a secret spot regularly, but it is a struggle, and we give up. No matter where you fall on this spectrum, I invite adults and youth of all ages to join Wilderness Awareness Schools' first 30-Day Sit Spot Challenge!

Go to your Secret Spot every day for at least 20 minutes. The starting date is Friday, February 15, 2008 and will continue to March 15, 2008.

Rain (or snow), or shine, night or day, blindfolded or sighted, go to that beautiful place and the sky's the limit. Do a sense meditation. Stalk up on the black cat that stalks the winter wrens. Dance. Build a fire. Whatever it is that you do when you go there, just do it! Even if you're traveling, sit somewhere each day.</blockquote>

I've accepted. Would anyone else like to join in the challenge?
