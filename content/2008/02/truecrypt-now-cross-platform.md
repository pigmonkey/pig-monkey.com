<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> is finally <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=version-history">available for OS X</a>! Though my primary OS was Linux up till just last November, I've been waiting on this for a while longer. Last year I used a Mac at work, and would frequently want to decrypt TrueCrypt disks that I carry around on my flash drive.

I'm plan to donate to the project when my next paycheck comes in.
