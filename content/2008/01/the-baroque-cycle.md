After re-reading Neal Stephenson's <em>The Diamond Age</em> last November, I had an inkling to do the same with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle">The Baroque Cycle</a>, Stephenson's tome on Alchemy, Economics, Technology, and an agreeable amount of Swashbuckling in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. It is an account of the birth of our modern world-system.

<em>Quicksilver</em> and <em>The Confusion</em> I first read when they were published, but at the time <em>The System of the World</em> was released, I was distracted by other ruminations. By the time I was free, I felt too much time had passed since my experience with the first two books, so I never read the third. Now, I intend to read them back-to-back.

<em>Quicksilver</em> I finished in a week and half. <em>The Confusion</em> I've been reading for near the same amount of time and am roughly halfway through, though I fear it will take longer to complete. Allowing for (un)necessary distractions, I should like to finish the cycle by the end of February.
