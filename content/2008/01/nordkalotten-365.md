<a href="http://www.nrk.no/">Norwegian Broadcasting</a> has started to release high quality episodes of their show <a href="http://nrkbeta.no/norwegian-broadcasting-nrk-makes-popular-series-available-drm-free-via-bittorrent/">Nordkalotten 365 on bittorrent</a>. As near as I can tell from the first episode, the show is of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Monsen">Lars Monsen</a>, who seems to be some sort of Les Stroud type of fellow, filming himself during wilderness travels in Norway. Suffice to say, he punches a few fish. And the theme song seems to be a remix of the theme from The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.

Any Norwegian speakers care to subtitle it?
