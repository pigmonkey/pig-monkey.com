BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7326437.stm">Lots of water 'is little benefit'</a>

<blockquote>UK experts say research which finds drinking lots of water does little to improve health should not discourage people from topping up regularly.

A scientific review by the University of Pennsylvania said some people, such as athletes, may need to drink a lot.

But they found little evidence that flushing out toxins through drinking copious amounts improved health.

...

They wrote: "There is no clear evidence of benefit from drinking increased amounts of water.

"Although we wish we could demolish all of the urban myths found on the Internet regarding the benefits of supplemental water ingestion, we concede there is also no clear evidence of lack of benefit.

"In fact, there is simply a lack of evidence in general." 

Looking at other scientific papers revealed that while drinking more water did effect the rate at which various substances were cleared by the kidney, there was no suggestion that this led to any actual health benefits. </blockquote>

I've kept on my <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2008/02/09/water/">water diet</a>, with no further news of note to report on it. As the article states, there's no evidence of benefit or lack of benefit, but, as far as I can tell, it's not hurting anything.
