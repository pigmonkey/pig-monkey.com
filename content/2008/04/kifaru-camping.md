Saturday's forecast was for 67F and sun. I'd forgotten what anything above 55F felt like, so I loaded up my ruck and hit the trails. My new <a href="http://kifaru.net/tarps_hootches.html">Kifaru Parahootch</a> came along for its first night out.

I'm out in this area most weekends, but hadn't been to this lake before. It was great. Surrounded by a lot of new growth, and only a 13 mile hike. There was even a bench by the lake where I chose to make camp.
