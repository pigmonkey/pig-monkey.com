Outdoors Magazine went down a few weeks ago. The website used to be one of the best sources for bushcraft and survival techniques and tool reviews. In addition to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://outdoors-magazine.com">wayback machine</a> and other caching websites, all the old content has been turned into PDFs and <a href="http://outdoors.free.fr/OM-PDF/">made available here</a>. A 275 MB zip file of all the PDFs is also available, which I am <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/media/outdoors-magazine/all-om-pdf.zip">mirroring here</a>.

<h2>Update:</h2>

<a href="http://www.oldjimbo.com/Outdoors-Magazine/">Here</a> is another source for the individual articles in PDF format.

The whole of the site, with the articles in html, is <a href="http://outdoors.magazine.free.fr/">mirrored here</a>.
