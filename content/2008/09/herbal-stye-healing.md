A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye">stye</a> is a sort of pimple on the eyelid, caused by a bacterial infection at the root of the eyelash. The common treatment for the infection is applying a hot compress to the area, which encourages the stye to drain. I had a small stye on the inside of my lower left eyelid last week and decided to see if I could speed the healing process along with herbal experimentation. It ended up healing in 2 days.

The first day I applied a thyme compress to the area twice, for 15 minutes each. The compress I made by simply making a cup of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyme">thyme</a> tea (steeped for 20 minutes for medicinal strength) and soaking a sterile gauze pad in it (with occasional re-soaking throughout the 15 minutes process as the compress lost its warmth). Thyme contains Thymol, an antiseptic which acts as a sort of antibiotic.

Of course, with any infection, the most obvious thing to reach for is Echinacea. I was out of tincture at the time, but I made a cup of tea with some dried <em>Echinacea purpurea</em> root before bed the first night.

The second day I repeated the twice daily 15 minute compress, but this time with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricaria_recutita">Chamomile</a> (<em>Matricaria recutita</em>). Chamomile has a reputation as general-purpose healer, and is also a relaxant.

The morning of the third day, there was no evidence of the stye.
