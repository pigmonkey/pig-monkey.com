Another redesign! This one only 6 months from the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2007/12/08/a-redesign/">last</a>. How remarkable is that?

<!--more-->

The base template and heavy CSS of the last design made this change relatively simple. This time around, I'm using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">YUI Reset</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/">YUI Fonts</a>. I started using both of them a month or two ago on a couple other sites. It's hard to imagine building a site without them now. They take a lot of headaches out of CSS.

This design is not using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">YUI Grids</a>. I have used it before, but I don't think it offers any benefit with this kind of design. It's more suited toward a content intensive site with many nested divisions. Something like <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo's front page</a>.

You'll also notice a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> feed on the top of the index page. I've been trying to figure out what the appeal of Twitter is, but so far, it's escaped me. I figured embedding tweets on the site would provide extra encouragement for me to try it out. I think Twitter may lend itself to my summer on the road, too. So, we'll see how long that lasts. It seems to be noticeably slow, so I might have to find another way to pull the data. 

Another new feature is tags. I started tagging posts a while ago, but haven't displayed them till now. The majority of posts are not tagged. Maybe someday I'll go back and tag the 1,300 old posts -- but I doubt it.

Some kinks of the design are still being worked out, but if you notice anything strange -- whether it be from the redesign, <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/09/a-move-to-slicehost/">server move</a>, or <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/09/google-apps/">mail move</a> -- let me know.
