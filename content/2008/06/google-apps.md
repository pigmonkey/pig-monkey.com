Last week I outsourced my email to <a href="http://google.com/a/">Google Apps</a>.

For years, my paranoia has prevented me from moving my mail. I never liked the idea of Google parsing through each message for keywords to generate ads. In fact, I usually don't even allow Google to cookie me. But now most of my regular email contacts have started using GPG. Enough of my mail is now encrypted that I'm comfortable with Google.

I haven't decided yet if I prefer the Gmail interface or Thunderbird. In the web interface, I use <a href="http://getfiregpg.org/">FireGPG</a> for signing and d/encrypting, which of courses places signatures inline. Since I'm jumping back and forth between that and Thunderbird/Enigmail, in order to maintain some measure of consistency, I've told Enigmail to sign inline instead of using PGP/Mime. It is a bit annoying, and will probably frighten the sheeple, but that's the way it is for now.

So, please encrypt all email. And if you don't, be aware that Google is reading it.
