There's still 6" of snow on the ground (more predicted for tonight) and temperatures are hovering around 15-20 degrees Fahrenheit. The only runners on the trail this morning were myself, two women, and a fellow who looked to be in his 70s.

Two days ago (when the powder was fresh and the snow still falling), it was only me and a couple folks on skis.

What's with that? Why retreat to central heating when you can generate your own warmth, achieve the satisfying feeling of beating up your body, and be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cYWfq--Nw">harder, better, faster, stronger</a> the next day?

(Rinse, repeat.)
