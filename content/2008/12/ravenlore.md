One of my favorite bushcraft sites is the oft-overlooked <a href="http://www.ravenlore.co.uk/">Ravenlore</a>. The site is very simple, containing information on a number of <a href="http://www.ravenlore.co.uk/html/projects.html">projects</a> that cover the basics of the craft, such as cooking and cutting. Interspersed throughout the site are <a href="http://www.ravenlore.co.uk/assets/images/Bushcraft800.jpg">stunning photographs</a> that appear as if windows into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda">Arda</a>.

In addition to the site's excellent and diverse set of information, what appeals to me so much is the manner in which it is presented and organized. It creates a feeling of myth, framing bushcraft as a story that we move through while <a href="http://www.ravenlore.co.uk/html/hitting_the_trail.html">on the trail</a>. This is important, but undervalued. Joseph Campbell used to say that we were a people without myth. I disagree. I believe that we have an over-abundance of myth. Individuals must pick their own mythology to live within. Bushcraft, when taken as more as just wilderness survival skills, can be part of this.

Your life is a story. Pick up a pen and write it.
