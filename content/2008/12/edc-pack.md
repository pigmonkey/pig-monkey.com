I took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157611131325646/">photos of my EDC pack today</a>. I live in an urban area and commute on my bike, but I also use the pack during day hikes, so the pack includes an odd mix of urban, bicycle, and wilderness tools. All the items are identified by comments and notes on flickr.

The pack itself is a <a href="http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Equipment/Bags-And-Packs">TAD Gear FAST Pack EDC</a>, which is probably evident to most of you. It's been my every day carry pack for a little over a year now. I'm very pleased with it.

The gear that I EDC on my person is probably more interesting. Maybe someday I'll take pictures of that.
