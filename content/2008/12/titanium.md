I love titanium. It's so light, yet strong, and discolors beautifully when burned.

The <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/708071">Snow Peak Trek 700</a> has been with me on every foray into the wilderness for the past four years, and it's still going strong. It's my primary pot/mug/bowl, whether I'm cooking with a fire, canister stove, or alcohol. If I were to create a list of my top ten most valued possessions, I think this would be on it.

I've only had the <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/store/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=48&amp;products_id=999">Vargo Triad XE</a> for a few months, but it's quickly become my favorite stove. It's far lighter and more versatile than the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/2877399740/in/set-72157607433043270/">Esbit stove</a>. I haven't even looked at my Jetboil since purchasing the Triad. The stove burns both denatured alcohol and fuel tabs, giving it a wider operating potential than most stoves that burn only either one or the other. My experience with alcohol stoves is limited, so I can't compare the burn efficiency of the Triad to its competitors, but I, so far, have zero complaints.

If there's the slightest breeze out, the Triad will require a windscreen when burning alcohol (fuel tabs aren't quite as susceptible). Vargo provides <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/store/pages.php?pID=4&CDpath=1">instructions and a diagram</a> for building a windscreen yourself. I ended up purchasing a <a href="http://traildesigns.com/windscreens.html">Trail Designs Vari-Vent windscreen</a> from <a href="http://antigravitygear.com/proddetail.php?prod=TDWSV4">Anti-Gravity Gear</a>.
