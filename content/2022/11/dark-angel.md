In the pilot episode of [the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Angel_(American_TV_series)), the titular hero teams up with a pirate television journalist in the cyberpunk dystopia of Seattle. They broadcast the dirt about a Rich Bad Guyâ„¢, and protect a witness from being silenced before she can give her testimony in court. The implication being that facts are meaningful, and that the criminal justice system is functioning.

From the vantage of 2022, the show's dystopia is looking pretty optimistic.
