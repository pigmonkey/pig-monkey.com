I store tea in [Planetary Design Airscape Storage Canisters](https://planetarydesign.com/product/airscape-airless-coffee-storage-canister/). The setup consists of an 18/8 stainless steel bucket with two lids. The inner lid is a plunger that evacuates air inside the can down to the level of the contents. The outer lid just sits on top of the canister, providing a platform to allow other canister to be stacked on top. The bottom of the bucket has a silicon pad that improves stackability. All together its a nice system for keeping things fresh.

It comes in two sizes: medium and small. Medium is good for unrolled leaves with body (like [Mi Lan Xiang](/2022/10/mi-lan-xiang/)) or something you want to store a lot of (like [Hojicha](/2021/09/hojicha/)). Small is good for something with leaves that are flat (I like keeping [Pre-rain Dragonwell](https://redblossomtea.com/products/prerain-dragonwell) in stock), rolled (might I suggest [Jin Xuan](https://redblossomtea.com/products/jin-xuan)), or otherwise compact. I wish there was an even smaller size. Alas.

They are not appropriate for pu-erh, which needs to breathe. But for the teas I like to stock in my pantry, they're great. I've been using them for about three years now, and I do think they help extend the shelf life of my supplies.
