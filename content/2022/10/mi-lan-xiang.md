Title: On Mi Lan Xiang

[Mi Lan Xiang](https://redblossomtea.com/products/mi-lan-xiang-honey-orchid) is currently my favorite oolong, and probably my second favorite tea after [Hojicha](/2021/09/hojicha/).

I've found that it doesn't lend itself too well to the infuser-basket-in-mug method popular with most of us tea drinkers on this side of the Pacific Rim. A [gaiwan](http://www.teanerd.com/2007/03/beginners-guide-to-gaiwans.html) is needed to get the full experience. Roughly 4 grams of leaf, 4 ounces of 190 degree Fahrenheit water, 30 seconds.

This past summer I frequently brewed it cold, leaving it to sit in a teapot in the fridge overnight and then decanting into a bottle in the morning to take on a bike ride. Since it is just sitting in cold water for multiple hours, I'm less picky about the ratio. I use 24 ounces of water, probably around 8 grams of leaf, left in the fridge for 8 hours or so.
