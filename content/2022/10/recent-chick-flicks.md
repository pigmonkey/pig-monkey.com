[Kimi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14128670/) was described to me as [Rear Window](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/) crossed with [The Conversation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/). Both are great films. Kimi isn't as great, but I still enjoyed it. It delivered on that description.

[Watcher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12004038/) is another riff on the Rear Window thing. There were a couple times I found myself talking back to the screen because a character did something irrational, but overall I enjoyed it. The two main actors, playing the watcher and the watched, were great. The ending was great.

[Emily the Criminal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15255876/) is a film full assholes. But likeable assholes.

[A Good Woman Is Hard to Find](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6624144/) starts out sort of meh, but then the main character makes an excellent life choice that really kicks off the plot. [The score](https://matthewpusti.bandcamp.com/album/a-good-woman-is-hard-to-find-original-motion-picture-soundtrack) is by Makeup and Vanity Set, and [you know how I feel about that](/2021/11/recent-tech-noir/).

[Swallow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8372298/) shows us that all is not well in soulless bourgeois suburbia. This film was super weird and discomforting, but is exactly what I imagine the lifes of [Goop customers](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/08/what-goop-really-sells-women/596773/) to be like.

[Catch the Fair One](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11304504/) is a perfect film. 10/10. No notes.

I'm not much into boxing films, and this isn't one, but there's a sparring scene in the beginning in which I couldn't identify much in the way of acting. I had to pause the film and lookup the actors who play the main character and her trainer. Either they should be winning Academy Awards or they are professional fighters. Turns out, they're professional fighters.

Four of these films were scored by [Nathan Halpern](http://www.copticonmusic.com/), who does excellent work.
