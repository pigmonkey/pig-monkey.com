Rudy Project offers a [replacement lens program](https://www.rudyprojectna.com/pages/replacement-lens-program-warranty-claim) wherein they will replace any of their lenses for frames that are in the current year's product catalog. They require you send in the lens you want replaced, and charge $29.95 per pair.

I just learned about this warranty program a couple weeks ago and thought I'd give it a whirl. I sent in two pairs of lenses for my [Rydon spectacles](/2016/08/rudy/).

One pair was ImpactX Photochromic Black. These were one of the two original sets of lenses I bought with the Rydons in 2011. Prior to my [shine job](/2018/11/space-marine/), these were what I kept mounted in the Rydon chassis most of the time, with the RX carrier behind them. The lenses had some noticable scratches on them, I think caused by my face, the RX carrier, ImpactX lens, and other people's fists all coming into loving embrace.

The second pair was [ImpactX Photochromic Laser Red](/2018/11/laser-red/). These are the ones I've used almost everyday for the past 4.5 years. These had some minor scratches on them from normal use -- nothing that was noticeable when worn, but I figured as long as I was sending a package in for warranty I'd include these.

I classify both of these lenses as critical equipment, so I already had a spare pair of each. I was prepared for a long wait, or for Rudy to reject my claim because both lenses were still usable as is.

I put both lenses in a padded envelope, with a check for $59.90, and dropped it in the mail last Monday. The postage cost me $3.42. Today, nine days later, I received a package with two new lenses.

[Purchasing](https://www.rudyprojectna.com/products/rydon-replacement-lenses) those two lenses would cost $209.98. There's a lot of ridiculous markup in the eyewear industry, but knowing that I can easily replace my Rudy lenses for about 30% of their MSRP makes me happy to continue to do business with Rudy. In past years I've looked at third parties, such as [Revant](https://www.revantoptics.com/products/rudy-project-rydon-replacement-lenses-polarized-stealth-black), to expand my lens collection with less money. But now I can't say that I have any interest in purchasing lenses from anyone other than Rudy.
