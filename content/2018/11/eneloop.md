Title: A Reminder that Eneloops are a Good Buy

Recently I went through my [Eneloop batteries](https://www.panasonic.com/global/consumer/battery/eneloop/lineup.html), cycling those that I keep in devices. I decided to purchase another pack of AA and AAA batteries, not because I needed to replace any but because I have more devices to power. After ordering the new batch, I realized this was the first time I had purchased AA batteries in seven years. (I had purchased AAAs more recently -- three years ago -- again not to replace any, but because I needed more.) My seven year old batteries are still in service and hold on average 85% of their factory charge. I don't intentionally cycle through the full set of batteries, so some sit in storage holding their charge for years.

It doesn't get much better than that.

I [started using Eneloop rechargeable batteries in 2011](/2011/09/sanyo-eneloop-rechargeable-batteries/). The following year I [purchased a programmable charger](/2012/12/programmable-battery-charger/), allowing me to [track the health of my batteries in git](https://github.com/pigmonkey/battery). When not in service [I store the batteries in a Pelican 1060](/2015/10/batteries/).
