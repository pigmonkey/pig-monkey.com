I first found [the blog](https://electrospaces.blogspot.com) when they published [an alaysis of DNI James Clapper's hardware](https://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-phones-of-us-director-of-national.html). Other highlights include: [a review of the historical hotline between Washington and Bonn](https://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-hotline-between-washington-and.html), [the Korean hotline](https://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-hotlines-between-north-and-south.html), [a look at the equipment aboard the EP-3E reconnaissance plane](https://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-equipment-aboard-ep-3e-electronic.html), and [an overview of Obama's communication equipment](https://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-presidential-communications.html). Most of what they publish ends up in [my archive](/2018/11/archiving-bookmarks/). I'm intruiged by these technologies, and Electrospaces provides wonderfuly detailed glimpses into this obscure world.
