Title: Last month I mountain biked Cotopaxi.

I mounted the saddle at 15,000 feet. Thin air for pushing pedals -- everything feels like uphill, until it is, then it feels like something worse -- but I like to think it might have prepared me somewhat for the oxygen deprivation of my recent [respirator trials](/2018/11/respirator-considerations/). Integrating some sort of hypoxic training into a PT regime may be worth considering.
