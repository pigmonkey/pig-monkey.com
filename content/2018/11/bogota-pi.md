I flew through [El Dorado International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado_International_Airport) four times last month. On the final trip security was none too pleased when they spotted the [Bogota Pi toolset](https://www.serepick.com/products/bogota-pi-toolset.html) in my pack. The normal [Bogota Titans](https://www.serepick.com/products/bogota-titan.html) in my wallet were either missed or deemed not problematic. I found the experience ironic.

The [Sparrows Mini Jim](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/mj.htm) met with suspicion, but I just did my smile-nod-*no-hablo-español* routine and they put it back. One could make a convincing argument that [Super Mica Shims](https://redteamtools.com/super-mica-door-shims) are more appropriate for travel.
