Title: Sometimes you need a tub of grease.

But more frequently you just need a little. A few months ago I bought myself a [Dualco 700231 Grease Gun](http://www.dualco-inc.com/products.push.html) and a [Dualco 10547 4.5" nozzle](http://www.dualco-inc.com/products.tips.html). I filled the gun from a tub of [Phil Wood Waterproof Grease](https://www.philwood.com/products/gohc/oilngrease.php) that I've been working through for a handful of years. This made servicing [my pedals](https://www.crankbrothers.com/products/stamp-7-large) much easier and less messy than previous jobs. Purchases like this make me feel more like an adult.
