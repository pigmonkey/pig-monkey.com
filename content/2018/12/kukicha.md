Title: On Kukicha

Often referred to as "twig tea" on this side of the Pacific Rim, [Kukicha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukicha) is a Japanese tea made from the roasted twigs of *Camellia sinensis*. It is my everday tea, and probably my second favorite drink (behind water). I can't comment on the [purported health benefits](https://www.ediblewildfood.com/blog/2016/11/kukicha-tea-alkalizing-your-way-to-good-health/), but I find the nutty, earthy taste to be enjoyable, and I appreciate that it is very low in caffeine.

I also regularly enjoy green tea, but green tea is the only source of caffeine in my life. This makes it a drink that needs some thought as to total consumption quantity and scheduling (caffeine in the morning or evening is the antithesis of [optimizing for sleep](/2018/11/sleep/)). Kukicha I can enjoy anytime, including shortly before bed.

I was first introduced to Kukicha years ago by [Vavrek](http://vavrek.com/), who I assume found it through [macrobiotics](http://weblife.org/macrobiotics.html). Outside of that community, Kukicha hasn't seemed to have made significant inroads in the West. I rarely see it in stores. As a result I usually purchase mine from [Eden Foods](https://www.edenfoods.com/store/kukicha-tea-organic-twig-tea.html) (along with the occasional [umeboshi](https://www.edenfoods.com/store/umeboshi-plums.html) -- though that I can also resupply that by pedaling over to [Japantown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japantown,_San_Francisco)), but I've not performed a survey to see if there are better sources available.
