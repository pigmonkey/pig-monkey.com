I first learned of him via his [Designing for Entertainment lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo53PTCvH_Y) in 2016. It was an eye-opening insight into the amount of thought that goes into the objects that, as an audience member, are often unnoticeable. His lecture on the [failure of Jurassic World to provide anything of value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CofZ7xjGyI8) is another highlight.
