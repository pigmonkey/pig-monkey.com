I find stories about resilient infrastructure projects like [Alaska's highway recovery](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18128983/alaska-earthquake-roads-fixed-anchorage-damage), [the underground cathedral protecting Tokyo from floods](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181129-the-underground-cathedral-protecting-tokyo-from-floods) and [Switzerland's Porcupine Principle](/2013/02/switzerland/) to be inspirational (though I've heard Switzerland has moved away from this strategy in recent years, choosing to rely instead on hopes and dreams). These sorts of projects are what government defense budgets should be spent on.
