The story is in the tradition of [John le Carré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_le_Carr%C3%A9), if John le Carré wrote science fiction, and is well executed on all levels. It includes enjoyable moments of tradecraft, done in a way to communicate something about the characters rather than for the spectacle. I eagerly await [the second season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)#Season_2).
