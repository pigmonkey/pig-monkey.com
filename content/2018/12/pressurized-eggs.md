Title: Pressurized Eggs

As with [rice](/2018/12/rice/), "hard boiled" eggs are one of my go-to pressure cooker dishes when I don't have the time or inclination to cook a full meal. I only began using the pressure cooker for this in the past couple years, but it has proven to be faster and to produce consistently better results than actually boiling the eggs.

To cook the eggs, I put one cup of water in the pressure cooker, drop in a steaming tray, and place the eggs on the tray. I then use the 5-5-5 method, which means:

1. 5 minutes to reach high pressure
2. 5 minutes at high pressure
3. 5 minutes of natural pressure release, followed by quick release of any remaining pressure

After the pressure has been released, the eggs are placed in cold water to cool.

I use a [stainless steel steamer basket](https://www.amazon.com/Steamer-Stainless-Vegetable-Folding-Expandable/dp/B06Y4MCKFM/) for this, rather than the [Instant Pot Silicone Steam Rack](https://instantpot.com/portfolio-item/silicone-steam-rack/) that I use to make rice. The basket makes it easier to remove the eggs and steamer from the pot while they are still hot.
