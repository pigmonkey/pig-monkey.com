You know [Adam Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis) from [The Power of Nightmares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Nightmares), [HyperNormalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation), etc. [He tells the Economist](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/12/06/the-antidote-to-civilisational-collapse):

> This is the genius of what happened with computer networks. Using feedback loops, pattern matching and pattern recognition, those systems can understand us quite simply. That we are far more similar to each other than we might think, that my desire for an iPhone as a way of expressing my identity is mirrored by millions of other people who feel exactly the same. We're not actually that individualistic. We're very similar to each other and computers know that dirty secret. But because we feel like we're in control when we hold the magic screen, it allows us to feel like we're still individuals. And that's a wonderful way of managing the world.

> Its downside is that it's a static world. It doesn't have any vision of the future because the way it works is by constantly monitoring what you did yesterday and the day before, and the day before that. And monitoring what I did yesterday and the day before and the day before that and doing the same to billions of other people. And then looking at patterns and then saying: "If you liked that, you’ll like this".
>
> They’re constantly playing back to you the ghosts of your own behaviour. We live in a modern ghost story. We are haunted by our past behaviour played back to us through the machines in its comparison to millions of other people’s behaviour. We are guided and nudged and shaped by that. It’s benign in a way and it's an alternative to the old kind of politics. But it locks us into a static world because it's always looking to the past. It can never imagine something new. It can't imagine a future that hasn't already existed. And it's led to a sense of atrophy and repetition. It's "Groundhog Day". And because it doesn't allow mass politics to challenge power, it has allowed corruption to carry on without it really being challenged properly.
