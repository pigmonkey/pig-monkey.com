Title: This past summer a 13-year-old girl shattered my optimism for the future.

In June, The Atlantic published an article [discussing the use of Instagram as a source of life advice by (pre-)teens](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/how-instagram-threads-became-the-wikihow-for-gen-z/561998/). I do not understand insta-face-tweeting, but what struck me most was 13-year-old Sophie's justification of her behaviour:

> Teens say they'd basically do anything to avoid searching for answers to their problems outside of Instagram. Unlike threads, web pages don't follow any standardized format, and teens say that navigating the open web, especially sites with ads and pop-ups, was a frustrating waste of time.
>
> "The format is just a lot easier to read than stuff like Google," says Sophie. "You can read longer things in little chunks. It's not like reading this giant paragraph at once. No one wants to do that."
>
> Teens say that another benefit of threads is that you don't have to waste time searching around -- the information is delivered to you based on your interests and whom you follow -- and that threads feel more trustworthy than search engines.

I'm not sure what sort of dystopic future we're in for if we manage to raise a generation of people who are intimidated by a paragraph, but I suppose we'll find out.
