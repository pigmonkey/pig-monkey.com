[The article](https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2018/11/23/the-arab-revolt-and-the-guns-of-lawrence-of-arabia/) is an extract from the author's [military history of Lawrence and his legacy](https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Mayhem-Lawrence-British-Military/dp/1612005748/), which I've added to my reading list. I was unaware that they made use of technicals, predating [Bagnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Alger_Bagnold) and his self-described ["piracy on the high desert"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Desert_Group).

> Lawrence had a talent for employing the Great War’s new technologies: semi-automatic pistols, airplanes, electric detonators, machine guns and motorcars. The equipment used by T.E. Lawrence and his colleagues against the Turks was innovative, as was his untraditional approach to the employment of intelligence, aerial reconnaissance and mobile gun platforms. His methodologies were game-changers and would heavily influence what would later be known as special operations in the British military, not to mention guerrilla leaders such as Mao Zedong and Võ Nguyên Giáp.
