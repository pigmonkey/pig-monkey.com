Purchase a roll of [3M Scotchlite 3150A SOLAS Grade Reflective Tape](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Scotchlite-3150A-Reflective-Conspicuity/dp/B015PFXB64/) and pack of [Velcro 7/8" Squares](https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Fasteners-Perfect-Squares-x/dp/B00SAY7RP4/). Stick a loop square on the tape and trim. The sticky-on-sticky action is unnecessary -- sometimes I'll just place the SOLAS tape on normal, sew-on loop Velcro -- but those 7/8" squares are the right size for a ranger eye, and the sticky hook component is useful for putting on whatever object you want to mount the ranger eye too. This can be used to increase side visibility on a helmet, but still give you the option to easily remove the reflective material when you want to decrease visibility.
