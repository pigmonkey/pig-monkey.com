Title: Part of my motivation for undergoing PRK surgery was a hope for the future of augmented reality and an expectation that it will be easier to integrate into daily life if one does not also need to worry about prescription lenses.

This past weekend I visited [Onedome's Unreal Garden](https://onedome.global/experiences/the-unreal-garden/), which uses the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) to attempt to provide an immersive art experience. The technology is glitchy and clearly immature, but it is at a level where the locative art of [Spook Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country) is certainly achievable. We seem to be a ways off from daily integration and wetware implants, but I think the future of [AR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) is promising.
