The size and weight constraints of the lifestyle means that they tend towards gear that is compact and multifunctional, the corrosion inherent in the environment and the time they spend away from easy resupply points encourages them to favor durability and repairability, and the fact that their entire living accommodations can be violently moved prompts them to spend time considering how to optimize storage and organization.

One of the blogs in this world that I occasionally follow is [The Boat Galley](https://theboatgalley.com/). I've been happy with the handful of (mostly kitchen related) purchases I've made based off of Carolyn's recommendation ([including](https://theboatgalley.com/gsi-stainless-boat-toaster/) the [aforementioned toaster](/2018/12/toast/)). Another mainstay is, of course, [Nomadic Research Labs](https://microship.com/) by Steve Roberts who, in my opinion, can do no wrong.
