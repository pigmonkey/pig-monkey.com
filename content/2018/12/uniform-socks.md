Title: I subscribe loosely to the idea of a daily uniform.

Loosely because I own more than one style of shirt, jacket, and pants. But I do try to keep things paired down, and standardizing on the color black means everything goes together and is largely fashion-agnostic. The approach reduces mental taxation.

I am more firm in the area of socks. [Darn Tough](https://darntough.com/) makes the best socks, and the [Tab No Show Light Cushion](https://darntough.com/collections/mens-fitness/products/tab-no-show-light-cushion?variant=30180628231) is the best Darn Tough sock. I bought my first pair in 2009. Over the subsequent years I have added a few additional pairs to my collection, but those original socks continue to be in regular rotation. I maintain a small number of other socks in my arsenal for specialty purposes -- a couple pair of boot socks for those rare occasions when I wear tall boots, a couple pair of toe socks for augmenting huarache style sandals, and a pair of waterproof socks I bought to experiment with -- but for almost all of my sock-wearing days each year I have the Tab No Show Light Cushion socks on my feet.
