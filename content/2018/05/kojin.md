I purchase a modified [StarLyte](http://www.woodgaz-stove.com/starlyte-stove.php) a couple years ago but haven't used it much. It burns well but is difficult to light with a spark unless it is slightly overfilled. The [Kojin](https://www.traildesigns.com/products/kojin-stove) takes a spark easily. It is lightweight, durable, can be snuffed with its lid, and holds enough fuel for a short overnight trip. I haven't measured fuel consumption or boil times, but it seems difficult to find anything to fault with the Kojin. I doubt I'll carry a [12-10](https://www.traildesigns.com/products/12-10-stove) with my Ti-Tri again.
