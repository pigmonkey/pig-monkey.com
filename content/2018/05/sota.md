We took a short hike up to [Ground Equipment Facility J-33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_Equipment_Facility_J-33) on the West Peak of [Mt. Tam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tamalpais). This was the first time I'd been back up there since [Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) 2017. I was able to get two contacts on 2 meters with my VX-8DR, and another two on 20 meters with one of the other operator's KX3. The club has [more photos](https://www.sfarc.org/home/1st-annual-sfrc-sota-activation-may-12th-2018).
