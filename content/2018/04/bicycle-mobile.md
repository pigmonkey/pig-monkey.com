Bicycles are fun. So are radios. Why not combine them.

For overnight trips I run my [Yaesu VX-8DR](https://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/9029) in the handlebar bag, with the MH-74A7A hand mic and FGPS-2 module, and a [Diamond SRH320A](https://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/4298). This let's me broadcast [APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System), letting people know where I am, and is everything I need to hit area repeaters to see if there's anything interesting going on. Calling in as "bicycle mobile" usually generates interest, and it's fun to check into a net without having to stop pedaling.

After pitching camp I can kill time by making more contacts. Also on this trip was a [Nelson Antennas Slim Jim](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DELUXE-MODEL-ROLL-UP-2M-70CM-ROLL-UP-J-POLE-SLIM-JIM-ANTENNA-WITH-10FT-COAX-/190898779511), but I didn't bother putting it up.

I'm not quite up to [Steve Roberts' level](https://microship.com/bikes/), but I'm also only pushing a fraction of the weight.
