[BRouter](http://brouter.de/brouter/) is [open source](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) navigation software built on [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), intended primarily for bicycle routing. It offers both [web](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=btools.routingapp) versions. The Android version calculates routes as GPX tracks, which are then fed into a mapping application. My preferred OpenStreetMap application, [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/), supports BRouter as its navigation back-end. OsmAnd allows me to configure the frequency, repetition and units of instructions. I use [Ivona TTS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ivona.tts) with the [UK voice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ivona.tts.voicebeta.eng.gbr.amy), which I think sounds more natural than either the Ivona US voice or Google's TTS offerings. In sum, this gives me accurate, offline navigation, tuned to my method of travel, anywhere on the planet, with superior maps to traditional commercial offerings.

Carry a towel and don't panic.
