The [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna:_New_Moon) tells the story of dynasties struggling for power on the moon, which has been settled and turned into a mining colony. It has been described as "Game of Thrones in space". While I have not read Game of Thrones, that seems like a roundabout way of saying that it is like [another series that deals with the struggles of feudal families mining resources in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)). Luna is much like Dune -- even up to including a female religious order interested in long term breeding programs and social experiment (funded by [The Long Now](http://longnow.org/), of course). Fans of classic science fiction will likely feel at home in its pages. I look forward to the sequel.
