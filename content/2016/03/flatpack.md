It's the first solution I've found that allows me to carry a [SOFTT-W](http://www.tacmedsolutions.com/product/sof-tactical-tourniquet-wide/) on-body, comfortably and unobtrusively. The [Flatpack](http://www.snakehoundmachine.com/product/phlster-flatpack/) prevents the need to resort to [a secondary tourniquet for first line carry](/2015/02/tq/), which makes it a valuable supplement to any EDC. BFE Labs offers an overview of the product in their [first look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbquKPkxHL4).
