The CIA's [A Tradecraft Primer](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/publications-rss-updates/tradecraft-primer-may-4-2009.html) is a brief introduction to critical thinking and structured analysis. Its techniques are not limited to intelligence, but instead are applicable to any field where the bias of preconceived notions may cause harm. Its short length makes it a worthwhile read -- I read it in a little over an hour while waiting for a plane -- particularly as an adjunct to publications like [Red Team Journal](http://redteamjournal.com/).
