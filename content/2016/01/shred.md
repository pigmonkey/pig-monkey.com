I purchased the [AmazonBasics 8-Sheet Micro-Cut Shredder](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008R52BRA) a few months ago. For the price I think it's a good buy. The CD shredding is a bit of a joke (use scissors), but it handles paper and cards admirably, cutting them into 4mm x 12mm pieces that will foil the casual antagonist. The 8-sheet capacity, compact size, and low cost make it a good choice for personal document filing. Tis the season.
