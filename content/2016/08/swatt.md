Title: A Place for the SWAT-T

My dislike of the [SWAT Tourniquet](http://www.swat-t.com/) stems from its difficulty to self-apply one-handed. That eliminated it from the running when evaluating [pocket tourniquets](/2015/02/tq/), but the [PHLster Flatpack](/2016/03/flatpack/) has made that category of tool less relevant. Now that I can easily and comfortably carry a primary tourniquet (specifically, a [SOFTT-W](http://www.tacmedsolutions.com/product/sof-tactical-tourniquet-wide/)) on-body, I've rethought what I should be carrying in my pack.

In the past I've carried a SOFTT-W as part of a small blow-out kit. The kit is in a [Triple Seven Gear Micro Kit](http://www.20dollarbandit.com/micro-kit/) pouch, which fits easily into whatever pack I'm using. If I'm already carrying a SOFTT-W on my belt, is carrying a second one the best use of the available weight and space? The SWAT tourniquet does have a few things going for it. It works well as a tourniquet, as long as you have two hands to apply it. The width of the SWAT-T allows it to occlude blood flow at a relatively low pressure, and its elasticity can help it to compensate for muscle relaxation. It can function as part of a pressure dressing, or be used to improve an improvised splint, swathe, or sling. And it burns well.

I decided to replace the SOFTT-W in my blow-out kit with a SWAT-T. With a SOFTT-W in the PHLster Flatpack on my belt, I'm confident in my ability to quickly administer self-aid. Having the SWAT-T in my bag gives me additional options, whether I need to use it as a second tourniquet or as something else.
