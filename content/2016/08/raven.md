The [Elzetta Alpha A323](https://www.elzetta.com/product/A323/) has been part of my EDC for 2 years now. For all but a few weeks of that time I've been carrying it on my belt with a [Prometheus Lights Titanium Pocket Clip](http://www.darksucks.com/store%20DS_SFClip.html), which works great on the Alpha. I changed over to the [Raven Concealment Systems Pocket Clip](http://raven-concealment-systems1.mybigcommerce.com/surefire-p-and-g-series-pocket-clip/) to get the finger ring, which is just a large rubber O-ring that allows you to use your hands for something else without dropping the light.
