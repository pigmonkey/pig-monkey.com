In his decade at the FBI, [Soufan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Soufan) developed an expertise in al-Qadea, investigating the Kenyan embassy bombing, Jordan millennium pole, attack on the USS Cole, and the September 11th attacks. [The book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393079422) is a history of al-Qaeda, beginning with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, as well as a memoir of the author's experience investigating the organization. It is a well-written, intriguing read that offers a different insight into familiar stories. I was inspired to read it after subscribing to the [The Soufan Group](http://soufangroup.com/)'s daily IntelBriefs and have not been disappointed.
