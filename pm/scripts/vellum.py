At home, things like my wireless mouse need power. The biggest drain are my lights -- particular in the winter, when they are used to [light my regular commute](http://pig-monkey.com/2011/02/20/lighting-my-ride-with-twofish/).\r\n\r\nThis last spring I decided to invest in a set of rechargeable batteries. Although some of my devices run on CR123 batteries, most use AA or AAAs. To start with, I was concerned only with being able to recharge the AA and AAA batteries. Years ago I had a set of rechargeable batteries, but I think the technology was not very developed back then. They seemed to drain quickly and not hold many charges. Today, the market is different. Some brief research showed that there were many options out there, with positive reviews for most of them.\r\n\r\nWhat most reviews seemed to suggest was that the majority of the offerings were all of equal quality, with most differences unlikely to be noticed outside of a laboratory. The most popular, though, seemed to be the [Sanyo Eneloop](http://www.eneloop.info/) and [Maha Powerex](http://www.mahaenergy.com/) batteries. I found some claims that, between the two, the Eneloops held a charge longer while on the shelf.\r\n\r\nI decided to try the Eneloop batteries, and purchased [a package](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VLAEPQ/) that included a charger, 8 AAs and 4 AAAs. The charger can charge up to four batteries at once, either AAA or AA, but it must be done in pairs. It cannot charge one battery at a time, or three. This has turned out to be an occasional inconvenience. I have some devices that use three batteries, and some that need just one. To charge the batteries for those devices I always have to give the charger an extra battery.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6182998631/" title="Sanyo Eneloop Charger by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6182998631_f9bd178f08_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Sanyo Eneloop Charger"></a>\r\n\r\nThe charger takes around five hours to bring a dead battery up to a full charge. I have read that the [Maha Powerex MH-C9000](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NLUSLM) charger can charge the batteries in a shorter period of time. It also gives the user more control over the charge, which has the potential of increasing the life of the batteries.\r\n\r\nThe batteries themselves I have been very happy with. I don\'t have the knowledge to provide any objective information on their chemistry or electronics. Suffice it to say that they work. They *seem* to last longer in the same devices than their non-rechargeable counterparts did. I have not noticed any degradation in those batteries that I have recharged. That is not surprising. Sanyo claims the Eneloop batteries can be recharged 1,500 times -- a number I have not come anywhere near to approaching.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6182962361/" title="Electronics Powered by Eneloops by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6182962361_f4bb5fb1d2_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Electronics Powered by Eneloops"></a>\r\n\r\nSince the initial purchase, I have bought two more packs of AA and AAA Eneloops. All of my electronics now run on rechargeable batteries, save for those few that require CR123 batteries. The batteries themselves are an expensive investment, but they have payed off. Now that I have a good number of both AA and AAA sizes, and am happy with the Eneloop brand, I would like to purchase a more specialized charger, such as the aforementioned C9000.\r\n\r\nIf you use any non-rechargeable AA or AAA batteries in your electronics, I recommend giving Eneloops a try. The financial savings alone is enough of a benefit to justify their use.'

    vellum_post_4.body = u'I purchased a pair of [Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters](http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/or-gear/gaiters/trail/flex-tex-gaiters.html) last spring. I had owned the full-length [Rocky Mountain High Gaiters](http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/or-gear/gaiters/trail/rocky-mtn-high-gaiters-m-s.html) from Outdoor Research for a year, and was a big fan of them. They are not completely waterproof, but are highly water-resistant, and still maintain a level of breathability that makes them appropriate for year-round use. I find them adequate for protecting my legs when bushwhacking and for keeping me warm and dry when traveling in rain and snow -- but I\'m always looking to loose weight. My eye had been on the Flex-Tex gaiters for a while. I thought that they would be a good alternative to full-length gaiters during the warmer months: something lighter and cooler which could provide protection from debris but would also handle the wet and snow that is often found in the alpine summer.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to purchase the gaiters, I found that sizing was an issue. Unlike Outdoor Research\'s other gaiters, the Flex-Tex do not come in normal sizes. They are offered only in the combination sizes of Small/Medium and Large/Extra Large. In the Rocky Mountain High gaiters I wear a medium. The Small/Medium Flex-Tex gaiters were far too small for me to even get on. The Large/Extra Large gaiters fit well around my footwear, but were loose at the top around my calf. Unlike other gaiters from Outdoor Research, the Flex-Tex had no adjustment to tighten the fit.\r\n\r\nI purchased them anyway, thinking to give them a shot. After using them on an early season trip in the snow, it was evident that they would not work. The loose top allowed too much snow to enter the gaiter.\r\n\r\nRather than giving up on the gaiters and immediately returning them, I held on to them for a while. I thought that it would be simple enough to modify the gaiters by adding a new cuff on top of the gaiter, creating a channel of material through which could run a thin piece of webbing. The webbing could be cinched down around the leg and secured with a camlock. This would provide the same adjustment mechanism as that found on my full-length gaiters. It would not be a perfect seal, but short gaiters will never keep out as much debris as tall ones.\r\n\r\nThe gaiters lay neglected for a while. A few months later I found myself in [Seattle Fabrics](http://seattlefabrics.com/) and wound up purchasing the needed webbing, as well as some stretchy Lycra material which I thought would serve as the added cuff. Then I forgot about the project again.\r\n\r\nEventually, I remembered the gaiters, and wanted to get them done. At that time I had some material left over from hemming a new pair of [Kuiu Attack Pants](http://shop.kuiu.com/attack-pant-p12.aspx). The Kuiu pants are made out of Toray Primeflex, an impressive soft-shell which I discussed in my [review of the Kuiu Guide Gloves](http://www.itstactical.com/gearcom/clothing/kuiu-guide-gloves-mountain-tested-mountain-approved/). While heavier than the Lycra, I thought that Primeflex would provide more durability and be a better match to the soft-shell of the Flex-Tex gaiters.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6127366548/" title="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6206/6127366548_792d2c6828_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters"></a>\r\n\r\nThe project was a success. With the Primeflex cuff sewn atop the gaiters\' normal cuff and a piece of webbing put through it, I can cinch down the top of the gaiter around my calf and secure it with the camlock buckle. Because the top of the gaiter has not been modified to be permanently smaller, I can still wear the gaiters over pants -- although I almost always wear them next to skin. I have not done much post-holing in snow this summer, but the new cuff has provided a tight enough seal to keep out flying snow that comes from glissading down snowy slopes and kicking steps on the way up. Neither rocks, dirt, nor twigs have yet to find their way in.\r\n\r\n<ul class="thumbs">\r\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6126824907/" title="Cuff, Webbing, and Camlock by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6126824907_3a66bdf7b3_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" alt="Cuff, Webbing, and Camlock"></a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6127377524/" title="A Second Sewing Style by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6127377524_9b8e32351a_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" alt="A Second Sewing Style"></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nNow that I have a proper fit, the Flex-Tex gaiters have become my preferred wear. They are breathable, water-resistant, and tough. At [5.29 ounces](http://gear.pig-monkey.com/outdoor-research-flex-tex-gaiters-lxl/), the modified gaiters are only slightly lighter than the [6.98 ounces](http://gear.pig-monkey.com/outdoor-research-rocky-mountain-high-gaiters/) Rocky Mountain High gaiters. It is not a huge difference, but I find that I still prefer the Flex-Tex gaiters. The Rocky Mountain gaiters I never wore specifically for debris. They stayed in my pack until I encountered wet or snow. The Flex-Tex gaiters are comfortable and breathable enough to wear all the time -- even when gaiters are not necessarily needed -- which makes them more efficient at keeping out debris. For my type of travel, I find the Flex-Tex gaiters more functional than short gaiters that I\'ve tried from other companies, such as [Integral Designs](http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=765) and [Dirty Girl](http://www.dirtygirlgaiters.com/).\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6126814181/" title="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6126814181_0f1032534d_b.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters"></a>'

I thought that they would be a good alternative to full-length gaiters during the warmer months: something lighter and cooler which could provide protection from debris but would also handle the wet and snow that is often found in the alpine summer.</p>\n<p>When I went to purchase the gaiters, I found that sizing was an issue. Unlike Outdoor Research&#8217;s other gaiters, the Flex-Tex do not come in normal sizes. They are offered only in the combination sizes of Small/Medium and Large/Extra Large. In the Rocky Mountain High gaiters I wear a medium. The Small/Medium Flex-Tex gaiters were far too small for me to even get on. The Large/Extra Large gaiters fit well around my footwear, but were loose at the top around my calf. Unlike other gaiters from Outdoor Research, the Flex-Tex had no adjustment to tighten the fit.</p>\n<p>I purchased them anyway, thinking to give them a shot. After using them on an early season trip in the snow, it was evident that they would not work. The loose top allowed too much snow to enter the gaiter.</p>\n<p>Rather than giving up on the gaiters and immediately returning them, I held on to them for a while. I thought that it would be simple enough to modify the gaiters by adding a new cuff on top of the gaiter, creating a channel of material through which could run a thin piece of webbing. The webbing could be cinched down around the leg and secured with a camlock. This would provide the same adjustment mechanism as that found on my full-length gaiters. It would not be a perfect seal, but short gaiters will never keep out as much debris as tall ones.</p>\n<p>The gaiters lay neglected for a while. A few months later I found myself in <a href="http://seattlefabrics.com/">Seattle Fabrics</a> and wound up purchasing the needed webbing, as well as some stretchy Lycra material which I thought would serve as the added cuff. Then I forgot about the project again.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I remembered the gaiters, and wanted to get them done. At that time I had some material left over from hemming a new pair of <a href="http://shop.kuiu.com/attack-pant-p12.aspx">Kuiu Attack Pants</a>. The Kuiu pants are made out of Toray Primeflex, an impressive soft-shell which I discussed in my <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/gearcom/clothing/kuiu-guide-gloves-mountain-tested-mountain-approved/">review of the Kuiu Guide Gloves</a>. While heavier than the Lycra, I thought that Primeflex would provide more durability and be a better match to the soft-shell of the Flex-Tex gaiters.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6127366548/" title="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6206/6127366548_792d2c6828_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters" /></a></p>\n<p>The project was a success. With the Primeflex cuff sewn atop the gaiters&#8217; normal cuff and a piece of webbing put through it, I can cinch down the top of the gaiter around my calf and secure it with the camlock buckle. Because the top of the gaiter has not been modified to be permanently smaller, I can still wear the gaiters over pants &#8212; although I almost always wear them next to skin. I have not done much post-holing in snow this summer, but the new cuff has provided a tight enough seal to keep out flying snow that comes from glissading down snowy slopes and kicking steps on the way up. Neither rocks, dirt, nor twigs have yet to find their way in.</p>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6126824907/" title="Cuff, Webbing, and Camlock by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6126824907_3a66bdf7b3_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" alt="Cuff, Webbing, and Camlock" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6127377524/" title="A Second Sewing Style by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6127377524_9b8e32351a_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" alt="A Second Sewing Style" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that I have a proper fit, the Flex-Tex gaiters have become my preferred wear. They are breathable, water-resistant, and tough. At <a href="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/outdoor-research-flex-tex-gaiters-lxl/">5.29 ounces</a>, the modified gaiters are only slightly lighter than the <a href="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/outdoor-research-rocky-mountain-high-gaiters/">6.98 ounces</a> Rocky Mountain High gaiters. It is not a huge difference, but I find that I still prefer the Flex-Tex gaiters. The Rocky Mountain gaiters I never wore specifically for debris. They stayed in my pack until I encountered wet or snow. The Flex-Tex gaiters are comfortable and breathable enough to wear all the time &#8212; even when gaiters are not necessarily needed &#8212; which makes them more efficient at keeping out debris. For my type of travel, I find the Flex-Tex gaiters more functional than short gaiters that I&#8217;ve tried from other companies, such as <a href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=765">Integral Designs</a> and <a href="http://www.dirtygirlgaiters.com/">Dirty Girl</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6126814181/" title="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6126814181_0f1032534d_b.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Modified Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters" /></a></p>'

    vellum_post_5.body = u'The Spider Gap &#8211; Buck Creek loop is one of the most popular trips in the north Cascades. For 40 miles the trail winds through the [Glacier Peak Wilderness](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak_Wilderness). It takes the traveler through low, emerald valleys and atop high alpine ridges. \r\n\r\nSpider Gap\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe trail along Phelps Creek is well used by hikers and hunters. It is a wide horse road, leading through thick woods. When I arrive in the middle of the week there are three different groups heading out, but no one else going in. It looks as if I have hit a lull in the summer crowds.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the valley the forest thins, giving way to wide meadows, good camps, and the remnants of avalanche slides. Two grouse hunters were tramping through the meadows, and one person hunting the opening of archery season for deer. None of them had so far had any luck.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117822132/" title="Spider Meadow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6117822132_db9ddca13a_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Spider Meadow"></a>\r\n\r\nFrom Spider Meadows my route climbs up the first of many ridges. I was aiming for Spider Gap, a small pass between towering rock, carved by the small but powerful Spider Glacier. The trail is steep. The noontime sun strikes it hard. Trees are soon left behind in the valley bottom, and any shade left with them. An occasional cooling breeze gives reason to stop and gaze back down to the valley of Phelps Creek below.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117311295/" title="Spider Meadow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117311295_8a1f5277b1_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Spider Meadow"></a>\r\n\r\nSoon I hit talus. Soon after, the source. Spider Glacier: narrow but long, and uphill to the Gap. I put my trekking pole into the pack, trading it for an ice axe. The year\'s heavy snow and late melt-off means that the glacier is still covered with a coat of snow. I progress slowly, but the snow allows for a relatively easy walk up without the traction devices that would be necessary had I been walking on the ice itself. All the way up, I think to myself that I should have done the loop in reverse, so that I could glissade down the glacier rather than walk up it. (Later, I shared my observations with others I encountered on the trail. None seemed to agree. "You have a different idea of fun that I do," said one.)\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117878442/" title="Spider Glacier by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6088/6117878442_f89bb56eed_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Spider Glacier"></a>\r\n\r\nAt the head of the glacier and the top of the gap I drop pack to hydrate and take in the views. This is surely mountain goat country -- bare, carved rock and spiring peaks abound. Peering down the other side I spot the [ever diminishing](http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/lyman.htm) Lyman Glacier and the relatively young Upper Lyman Lakes. My goal for the day is the lower Lyman Lake, hidden in the trees beyond.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117934252/" title="Lyman Lakes and beyond to Cloudy Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6117934252_1530cbeb3f_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyman Lakes and beyond to Cloudy Peak"></a>\r\n\r\nSnow fields occasionally cover the rocky north facing slopes on the other side of the Gap, but I can see faint outlines of a trail where the snow has melted, traversing the western slope of Dumbell Mountain. Ice axe still in hand, I make my way in that direction.\r\n\r\nAs I reach the opposite side of a field of snow, I find myself among scree and boulders. No longer can I make out the previously spotted trail. I peer ahead, but I cannot see its relief anywhere along the slope. I\'m not sure what the trail was making for, anyways. When I did see it, it looked to keep the slope of the mountain, heading off perhaps to Rubin Creek on the other side. It is definitely not the obvious route given the topography. A few hundred feet below me I can see Upper Lyman Lakes, and the bare fields surrounding. It looks easy enough to just walk along the edge of the lakes, following the drainage down to lower Lyman Lake itself. Simpler than fooling around on the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117395455/" title="Lyman Glacier by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6117395455_837284f08c_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyman Glacier"></a>\r\n\r\nSo I begin the descent, lowering myself down large boulders, occasionally loosing my footing as I kick loose small rocks that go tumbling down. After some time I reach another snow field, steep and perhaps forty or fifty feet down to the other side. I could go around it, but it has been slow going, making my way among the rocks. "Ballsy," I think, but what\'s the point of packing an ice axe if you aren\'t going to really use it? I carefully step onto the snow, sit down, and push off.\r\n\r\nThe late season snow is hard packed and crusty, more like ice, which makes for a faster acceleration than I had planned. I cannot dig in with my heels or the spike of the axe enough to slow the descent. Nearing the bottom, I\'m forced to roll over and arrest with the pick of the axe to avoid flying into the talus below. That done, and feeling quite pleased with myself, I merrily make my way down the remaining hundred feet to the lakes below. Reaching the bottom, I spot good tread, and even a few cairns here and there. I don\'t know what route the path took down from the Gap -- it certainly wasn\'t the same as mine -- but there it is.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117948214/" title="Cairn at Upper Lyman Lakes by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6088/6117948214_daa2262b47_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Cairn at Upper Lyman Lakes"></a>\r\n\r\nThe tread soon turns to trail. Clouds begin to move in and, as I make my way to the lower lake, I feel drops of rain on my face. The trail descends into trees, reaching Lyman Lake itself soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nAt the lake there are a few other people already camped. I find a likely looking spot and pitch the tarp before the rain increases. It does not last long, soon diminishing to only occasional sprinkles. That and the accompanying breeze are enough to keep down any bugs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117419631/" title="Lyman Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6190/6117419631_4dc34c4547_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyman Lake"></a>\r\n\r\nA downed Hemlock tree next to my camp provides plenty of slightly-damp wood. I break off a few branches and after three minutes of processing have enough to fire up the [Inferno](http://pig-monkey.com/2011/07/29/fire-starting-trail-designs-ti-tri-inferno/). After dinner I have plenty of fuel left over, so I boil some water for hot chocolate. The fire is still going as I finish the drink, allowing me to heat a bit of water for cleaning and then dry the pot before putting it away. Then to bed.\r\n\r\nImage Lake\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nI rise early, break camp, and walk a couple hundred feet through the woods to the shore of the lake. Breakfast, and water, and then I\'m gone. I want to get on the trail ahead of the others, whom I assume are doing the same loop as I. The trail winds along the shore of the lake for a short while before breaking off to head north and west. It climbs out of forest, into the meadow below Cloudy Pass. Here I spook deer and marmot, the latter collecting grass for their winter holes. (Already, the temperature dropped to freezing last night.) I spotted blue sky as I woke, but now Cloudy Pass is living up to its name. Looking back, I see clouds moving in to veil Lyman Lakes and the Gap.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117979868/" title="Clouds over Spider Gap and Chiwawa Mountains by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6192/6117979868_2bd9c20249_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Clouds over Spider Gap and Chiwawa Mountains"></a>\r\n\r\nLow clouds obscure the country by the time I reach Cloudy Pass. Descending to the other side I catch tantalizing glimpses of massive walls of rock all around me. I rather enjoy this hiking, walking through the mists in country that is new to me. It is fitting for the second day of September, being in stark contrast to the sweaty hikes under strong sun that defined much of August.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118015000/" title="Cloudy Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6118015000_971d281dab_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Cloudy Pass"></a>\r\n\r\nAfter Cloudy Pass, I avoid the descent all the way into the valley bottom just to rise again by taking a shortcut along the side of a steep ridge to Suiattle Pass. At the top of the pass I look forward and can see mammoth slopes of snow obscured by trees and clouds. [Glacier Peak](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak) is in front of me, but still only allowing glimpses of its noble flanks. I step onto the Pacific Crest Trail and descend lower into thick trees, reaching the junction with the trail to Miners Ridge. Here the classic loop continues south along the PCT, but I intend to make the detour to Miners Ridge and spend a night at the famed Image Lake. There, the summit of Glacier towers over the lake and is reflected in the still waters, giving the lake its name.\r\n\r\nIt is late morning now. The sun has begun to burn off the clouds as I start the climb to the top of the ridge. Mining artifacts from the sixties liter the trail, making for interesting archaeological pauses. (The ridge was largely saved from being destroyed by copper mining thanks to [William O. Douglas](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/William_O._Douglas).)\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117540525/" title="Artifacts on Miners Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6075/6117540525_b2a1eef6d9_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Artifacts on Miners Ridge"></a>\r\n\r\nAs the trail climbs, the day warms, and the trees are once again left behind, revealing meadows which carpet the upper slopes of the ridge. The clouds are all but gone now. Under a blue sky, green fields roll out before me and, to the south, Glacier Peak, the Wilderness Sentinel, stands in all its glory, surrounded by its court of lesser peaks.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118127702/" title="Glacier Peak and Miners Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6118127702_7e581e7a9e_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Glacier Peak and Miners Ridge"></a>\r\n\r\nThe trail leads along the southern face of the ridge and descends to the small basin that holds Image Lake. There are good camps just south of the lake, where I drop my pack. It is just shortly after noon now, but I plan to spend the night here so that I may catch the sunrise over the lake the following morn. The rest of the day is spent exploring the basin and taking in the views.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117657145/" title="Image Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6077/6117657145_69fc12b911_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Image Lake"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117676237/" title="Evening at Image Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6117676237_ea71372816_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Evening at Image Lake"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118226030/" title="Glacier Peak over Image Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6118226030_73289040e8_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Glacier Peak over Image Lake"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117701155/" title="Crescent above Glacier Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6090/6117701155_3c0743ff2f_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Crescent above Glacier Peak"></a>\r\n\r\nBuck Creek Pass\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nI rise at half past five to a clear dawn. Down comes the tarp, and I throw my things into the pack and walk slightly up the ridge on the north shore of the lake. As the sun rises, it sets fire to the summit and upper glaciers of the peak. I eat breakfast as the show progresses, and soon the whole of Glacier is red with the dawn. That\'s my cue to leave. I pack up again, and retrace my steps east along the southern slope of Miners Ridge. There are plenty of deer out browsing, or perhaps they are just watching the sun rise.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117706935/" title="Dawn on Glacier Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6195/6117706935_66ee25e0b4_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Dawn on Glacier Peak"></a>\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the ridge I come to the end of my detour and once again gain the Pacific Crest Trail. There, the trail descends further to Miners Creek, re-entering thick old growth where the morning light has barely yet penetrated. After the creek is crossed, I leave the PCT and head south, aiming for Middle Ridge and Buck Creek Pass.\r\n\r\nI spend the rest of the morning in the old growth forest. The trail begins to climb, soon opening up to expose the avalanche-scoured slopes of Middle Ridge. The shady trees are left behind just as the sun reaches its peak. Views of the aptly named Fortress Mountain dominate the route.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118298770/" title="Fortress Mountain by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6118298770_b17420c5e0_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Fortress Mountain"></a>\r\n\r\nI stop for lunch at the top of Middle Ridge. The bugs, which have hitherto not been bothersome on this trip, encourage me to cut the break short. I descend once more, this time steeply into the valley of (not so) Small Creek. There is shade down here in the forest. I drop my pack again, this time for a more relaxing break.\r\n\r\nThere is one more climb ahead of me: up steep, dusty slopes to Buck Creek Pass, the last high point of the loop. It\'s a slog to get up there under the early afternoon sun, but, once gained, the pass offers close-up views of the eastern slopes of Glacier, rising steeply up from the deep Suaittle valley. Flower Dome, Helmet Butte and Liberty Cap surround the meadows here at the pass.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117802341/" title="Sign at Buck Creek Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6117802341_989e21f7f3_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Sign at Buck Creek Pass"></a>\r\n\r\nI see two groups camped at the pass, but it is early yet, and after yesterday\'s short day I want a longer hike today. The trail leads down to Buck Creek. I follow, into the last valley.\r\n\r\nThe trail chooses a long and gradual way down to the valley bottom. It is the weekend now. I pass many people on the way up, likely looking to sleep at the pass. I think that it will get a bit crowded up there tonight, and I\'m glad that I chose to come down to the cool and largely empty valley.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118359136/" title="Chiwawa Mountains and Buck Creek Valley by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6081/6118359136_147ee87d39_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Chiwawa Mountains and Buck Creek Valley"></a>\r\n\r\nIt\'s late afternoon and I figure that I\'ve come seventeen miles or so from Image Lake. Another four or five miles and I\'ll be at the Buck Creek trailhead, which I don\'t want to reach until tomorrow. Branching off the trail, I head close to Buck Creek and soon find a clearing large enough for my tarp. I decide on an early dinner, followed down with the last of the trail mix. Afterwards I entertain myself with a fire built up around the stove.\r\n\r\nTrinity\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe night is not as cold down in the valley as it was in the high country around Lyman and Image lakes, but it still gets down close to freezing. I wake early, shivering. The sun won\'t reach down here for a few hours yet.

    vellum_post_5.body_rendered = u'<p>The Spider Gap &#8211; Buck Creek loop is one of the most popular trips in the north Cascades. For 40 miles the trail winds through the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak_Wilderness">Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>. It takes the traveler through low, emerald valleys and atop high alpine ridges. </p>\n<h2>Spider Gap</h2>\n<p>The trail along Phelps Creek is well used by hikers and hunters. It is a wide horse road, leading through thick woods. When I arrive in the middle of the week there are three different groups heading out, but no one else going in. It looks as if I have hit a lull in the summer crowds.</p>\n<p>At the head of the valley the forest thins, giving way to wide meadows, good camps, and the remnants of avalanche slides. Two grouse hunters were tramping through the meadows, and one person hunting the opening of archery season for deer. None of them had so far had any luck.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117822132/" title="Spider Meadow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6117822132_db9ddca13a_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Spider Meadow" /></a></p>\n<p>From Spider Meadows my route climbs up the first of many ridges. I was aiming for Spider Gap, a small pass between towering rock, carved by the small but powerful Spider Glacier. The trail is steep. The noontime sun strikes it hard. Trees are soon left behind in the valley bottom, and any shade left with them. An occasional cooling breeze gives reason to stop and gaze back down to the valley of Phelps Creek below.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117311295/" title="Spider Meadow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117311295_8a1f5277b1_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Spider Meadow" /></a></p>\n<p>Soon I hit talus. Soon after, the source. Spider Glacier: narrow but long, and uphill to the Gap. I put my trekking pole into the pack, trading it for an ice axe. The year&#8217;s heavy snow and late melt-off means that the glacier is still covered with a coat of snow. I progress slowly, but the snow allows for a relatively easy walk up without the traction devices that would be necessary had I been walking on the ice itself. All the way up, I think to myself that I should have done the loop in reverse, so that I could glissade down the glacier rather than walk up it. (Later, I shared my observations with others I encountered on the trail. None seemed to agree. &#8220;You have a different idea of fun that I do,&#8221; said one.)</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117878442/" title="Spider Glacier by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6088/6117878442_f89bb56eed_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Spider Glacier" /></a></p>\n<p>At the head of the glacier and the top of the gap I drop pack to hydrate and take in the views. This is surely mountain goat country &#8212; bare, carved rock and spiring peaks abound. Peering down the other side I spot the <a href="http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/lyman.htm">ever diminishing</a> Lyman Glacier and the relatively young Upper Lyman Lakes. My goal for the day is the lower Lyman Lake, hidden in the trees beyond.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117934252/" title="Lyman Lakes and beyond to Cloudy Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6117934252_1530cbeb3f_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyman Lakes and beyond to Cloudy Peak" /></a></p>\n<p>Snow fields occasionally cover the rocky north facing slopes on the other side of the Gap, but I can see faint outlines of a trail where the snow has melted, traversing the western slope of Dumbell Mountain. Ice axe still in hand, I make my way in that direction.</p>\n<p>As I reach the opposite side of a field of snow, I find myself among scree and boulders. No longer can I make out the previously spotted trail. I peer ahead, but I cannot see its relief anywhere along the slope. I&#8217;m not sure what the trail was making for, anyways. When I did see it, it looked to keep the slope of the mountain, heading off perhaps to Rubin Creek on the other side. It is definitely not the obvious route given the topography. A few hundred feet below me I can see Upper Lyman Lakes, and the bare fields surrounding. It looks easy enough to just walk along the edge of the lakes, following the drainage down to lower Lyman Lake itself. Simpler than fooling around on the side of the mountain.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117395455/" title="Lyman Glacier by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6117395455_837284f08c_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyman Glacier" /></a></p>\n<p>So I begin the descent, lowering myself down large boulders, occasionally loosing my footing as I kick loose small rocks that go tumbling down. After some time I reach another snow field, steep and perhaps forty or fifty feet down to the other side. I could go around it, but it has been slow going, making my way among the rocks. &#8220;Ballsy,&#8221; I think, but what&#8217;s the point of packing an ice axe if you aren&#8217;t going to really use it? I carefully step onto the snow, sit down, and push off.</p>\n<p>The late season snow is hard packed and crusty, more like ice, which makes for a faster acceleration than I had planned. I cannot dig in with my heels or the spike of the axe enough to slow the descent. Nearing the bottom, I&#8217;m forced to roll over and arrest with the pick of the axe to avoid flying into the talus below. That done, and feeling quite pleased with myself, I merrily make my way down the remaining hundred feet to the lakes below. Reaching the bottom, I spot good tread, and even a few cairns here and there. I don&#8217;t know what route the path took down from the Gap &#8212; it certainly wasn&#8217;t the same as mine &#8212; but there it is.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117948214/" title="Cairn at Upper Lyman Lakes by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6088/6117948214_daa2262b47_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Cairn at Upper Lyman Lakes" /></a></p>\n<p>The tread soon turns to trail. Clouds begin to move in and, as I make my way to the lower lake, I feel drops of rain on my face. The trail descends into trees, reaching Lyman Lake itself soon thereafter.</p>\n<p>At the lake there are a few other people already camped. I find a likely looking spot and pitch the tarp before the rain increases. It does not last long, soon diminishing to only occasional sprinkles. That and the accompanying breeze are enough to keep down any bugs.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117419631/" title="Lyman Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6190/6117419631_4dc34c4547_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyman Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>A downed Hemlock tree next to my camp provides plenty of slightly-damp wood. I break off a few branches and after three minutes of processing have enough to fire up the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2011/07/29/fire-starting-trail-designs-ti-tri-inferno/">Inferno</a>. After dinner I have plenty of fuel left over, so I boil some water for hot chocolate. The fire is still going as I finish the drink, allowing me to heat a bit of water for cleaning and then dry the pot before putting it away. Then to bed.</p>\n<h2>Image Lake</h2>\n<p>I rise early, break camp, and walk a couple hundred feet through the woods to the shore of the lake. Breakfast, and water, and then I&#8217;m gone. I want to get on the trail ahead of the others, whom I assume are doing the same loop as I. The trail winds along the shore of the lake for a short while before breaking off to head north and west. It climbs out of forest, into the meadow below Cloudy Pass. Here I spook deer and marmot, the latter collecting grass for their winter holes. (Already, the temperature dropped to freezing last night.) I spotted blue sky as I woke, but now Cloudy Pass is living up to its name. Looking back, I see clouds moving in to veil Lyman Lakes and the Gap.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117979868/" title="Clouds over Spider Gap and Chiwawa Mountains by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6192/6117979868_2bd9c20249_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Clouds over Spider Gap and Chiwawa Mountains" /></a></p>\n<p>Low clouds obscure the country by the time I reach Cloudy Pass. Descending to the other side I catch tantalizing glimpses of massive walls of rock all around me. I rather enjoy this hiking, walking through the mists in country that is new to me. It is fitting for the second day of September, being in stark contrast to the sweaty hikes under strong sun that defined much of August.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118015000/" title="Cloudy Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6118015000_971d281dab_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Cloudy Pass" /></a></p>\n<p>After Cloudy Pass, I avoid the descent all the way into the valley bottom just to rise again by taking a shortcut along the side of a steep ridge to Suiattle Pass. At the top of the pass I look forward and can see mammoth slopes of snow obscured by trees and clouds. <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak">Glacier Peak</a> is in front of me, but still only allowing glimpses of its noble flanks. I step onto the Pacific Crest Trail and descend lower into thick trees, reaching the junction with the trail to Miners Ridge. Here the classic loop continues south along the PCT, but I intend to make the detour to Miners Ridge and spend a night at the famed Image Lake. There, the summit of Glacier towers over the lake and is reflected in the still waters, giving the lake its name.</p>\n<p>It is late morning now. The sun has begun to burn off the clouds as I start the climb to the top of the ridge. Mining artifacts from the sixties liter the trail, making for interesting archaeological pauses. (The ridge was largely saved from being destroyed by copper mining thanks to <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/William_O._Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>.)</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117540525/" title="Artifacts on Miners Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6075/6117540525_b2a1eef6d9_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Artifacts on Miners Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>As the trail climbs, the day warms, and the trees are once again left behind, revealing meadows which carpet the upper slopes of the ridge. The clouds are all but gone now. Under a blue sky, green fields roll out before me and, to the south, Glacier Peak, the Wilderness Sentinel, stands in all its glory, surrounded by its court of lesser peaks.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118127702/" title="Glacier Peak and Miners Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6118127702_7e581e7a9e_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Glacier Peak and Miners Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>The trail leads along the southern face of the ridge and descends to the small basin that holds Image Lake. There are good camps just south of the lake, where I drop my pack. It is just shortly after noon now, but I plan to spend the night here so that I may catch the sunrise over the lake the following morn. The rest of the day is spent exploring the basin and taking in the views.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117657145/" title="Image Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6077/6117657145_69fc12b911_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Image Lake" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117676237/" title="Evening at Image Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6117676237_ea71372816_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Evening at Image Lake" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118226030/" title="Glacier Peak over Image Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6118226030_73289040e8_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Glacier Peak over Image Lake" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117701155/" title="Crescent above Glacier Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6090/6117701155_3c0743ff2f_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Crescent above Glacier Peak" /></a></p>\n<h2>Buck Creek Pass</h2>\n<p>I rise at half past five to a clear dawn. Down comes the tarp, and I throw my things into the pack and walk slightly up the ridge on the north shore of the lake. As the sun rises, it sets fire to the summit and upper glaciers of the peak. I eat breakfast as the show progresses, and soon the whole of Glacier is red with the dawn. That&#8217;s my cue to leave. I pack up again, and retrace my steps east along the southern slope of Miners Ridge. There are plenty of deer out browsing, or perhaps they are just watching the sun rise.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117706935/" title="Dawn on Glacier Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6195/6117706935_66ee25e0b4_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Dawn on Glacier Peak" /></a></p>\n<p>At the bottom of the ridge I come to the end of my detour and once again gain the Pacific Crest Trail. There, the trail descends further to Miners Creek, re-entering thick old growth where the morning light has barely yet penetrated. After the creek is crossed, I leave the PCT and head south, aiming for Middle Ridge and Buck Creek Pass.</p>\n<p>I spend the rest of the morning in the old growth forest. The trail begins to climb, soon opening up to expose the avalanche-scoured slopes of Middle Ridge. The shady trees are left behind just as the sun reaches its peak. Views of the aptly named Fortress Mountain dominate the route.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118298770/" title="Fortress Mountain by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6118298770_b17420c5e0_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Fortress Mountain" /></a></p>\n<p>I stop for lunch at the top of Middle Ridge. The bugs, which have hitherto not been bothersome on this trip, encourage me to cut the break short. I descend once more, this time steeply into the valley of (not so) Small Creek. There is shade down here in the forest. I drop my pack again, this time for a more relaxing break.</p>\n<p>There is one more climb ahead of me: up steep, dusty slopes to Buck Creek Pass, the last high point of the loop. It&#8217;s a slog to get up there under the early afternoon sun, but, once gained, the pass offers close-up views of the eastern slopes of Glacier, rising steeply up from the deep Suaittle valley. Flower Dome, Helmet Butte and Liberty Cap surround the meadows here at the pass.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6117802341/" title="Sign at Buck Creek Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6117802341_989e21f7f3_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Sign at Buck Creek Pass" /></a></p>\n<p>I see two groups camped at the pass, but it is early yet, and after yesterday&#8217;s short day I want a longer hike today. The trail leads down to Buck Creek. I follow, into the last valley.</p>\n<p>The trail chooses a long and gradual way down to the valley bottom. It is the weekend now. I pass many people on the way up, likely looking to sleep at the pass. I think that it will get a bit crowded up there tonight, and I&#8217;m glad that I chose to come down to the cool and largely empty valley.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6118359136/" title="Chiwawa Mountains and Buck Creek Valley by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6081/6118359136_147ee87d39_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Chiwawa Mountains and Buck Creek Valley" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s late afternoon and I figure that I&#8217;ve come seventeen miles or so from Image Lake. Another four or five miles and I&#8217;ll be at the Buck Creek trailhead, which I don&#8217;t want to reach until tomorrow. Branching off the trail, I head close to Buck Creek and soon find a clearing large enough for my tarp. I decide on an early dinner, followed down with the last of the trail mix. Afterwards I entertain myself with a fire built up around the stove.</p>\n<h2>Trinity</h2>\n<p>The night is not as cold down in the valley as it was in the high country around Lyman and Image lakes, but it still gets down close to freezing. I wake early, shivering. The sun won&#8217;t reach down here for a few hours yet. Quickly, I complete the morning routine and regain the trail, looking to generate some heat with movement.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only been a couple hours on the trail when I reach the trailhead outside of the small town of Trinity (which looks to consist of three buildings).

    vellum_post_9.body = u'Continuing with my recent theme of short, low-mileage trips I ventured back into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness last weekend. After hitting snow at low elevations at the [Foss Lakes the previous week](http://pig-monkey.com/2011/08/14/yonder-alpine-lakes/), I decided this time to head east of the crest.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072004460/" title="Entering the Alpine Lakes by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6072004460_cb6bcdba7f_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Entering the Alpine Lakes"></a>\r\n\r\nWhitepine Creek runs just west of Leavenworth and provides a lesser known and lesser used route onto Icicle Ridge and the surrounding area, compared to the popular Icicle Creek Road. I reached the nearest trailhead at midmorning on Friday. As I pulled my pack out of the car, I realized something was missing. Whoops, no trekking pole! I only ever carry one pole anymore, and don\'t find it to be required gear for walking. Its import lies in the fact that I use it to set up my tarp. The pole isn\'t needed when I string up the tarp between two trees -- which I prefer to do whenever two conveniently placed trees present themselves at my intended camp -- but I would be getting high on this trip and thought it likely that I would be spending a night or two above tree line.\r\n\r\nNear the trailhead\'s bulletin board I spotted a few walking sticks leaning against a stump. Throwing the pack on my back, I walked over to the sticks and inspected the lot for one that would suit me. I found one that was light and skinny, but still strong enough to serve for any swift stream crossings that may lay ahead. It was a good height for walking, which meant it was too tall for the front beak of the tarp. I could cut it down to size later.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071456355/" title="Whitepine Trailhead by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6071456355_dd0b7016eb_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Whitepine Trailhead"></a>\r\n\r\nWith stick in hand, I headed out. The trail leads into the Whitepine valley, filled with thick pine woods which provide shade from the morning sun. Occasionally, I caught a glimpse of the valley ridge above. At two and a half miles, I reached a junction with Wildhorse creek, which drains into Whitepine on its way out of the mountains. I took a left and began the climb up the Wildhorse valley, to its head at Frosty Pass and the high country beyond.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072010242/" title="Whitepine Valley by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6072010242_13fc763465_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Whitepine Valley"></a>\r\n\r\nThe Whitepine and the Wildhorse sit in the [Chiwaukum Mountains](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chiwaukum_Mountains), which in Wenatchee means *many-little-creeks-leading-together*. True to form, dozens of small creeks flow down the otherwise dry eastern ridge of the Wildhorse, turning it into a wet hike. In places the trail was a creek. In others, the small amount of use and large amount of moisture had created thick patches of salmon berry and devil\'s club that obscured the trail. I push through it, hoping that I\'m the only one walking through this berry feast at the moment.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072016052/" title="A Thick Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6072016052_193b5e37bd_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="A Thick Trail"></a>\r\n\r\nAs the trail lead higher, the trees began to thin and the views along the opposite ridge reveal high peaks and green fields.\r\n\r\nWith wet, muddy feet I reached Frosty Pass sometime in mid-afternoon., around 10 miles and a few thousand feet of elevation from the trail head. The sun is strong. The weather forecast called for 90&deg;F down below. It doesn\'t feel much cooler up here.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071501439/" title="Frosty Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6071501439_be45b5d03b_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Frosty Pass"></a>\r\n\r\nFrom Frosty Pass, my route headed directly east and climbed up to Icicle Ridge. Shortly, I reached the first of the ridge\'s lakes, Lake Mary, which was my destination for the day.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071511595/" title="Above Lake Mary by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6071511595_ef54158508_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Above Lake Mary"></a>\r\n\r\nIn the time that it took to set my pack down and take a drink of water, I had dozens of mosquitos biting my skin. I was ready for them this time, after having a similar experience last week. Rain pants, rain jacket, hat, headnet and gloves all came out of my pack. I soon was protected inside a sweaty bug suit.\r\n\r\nI tied my tarp up between a couple trees, avoiding having to cut my walking stick down to length for a front pole. Below the tarp, went my bivy sack. Rain didn\'t seem likely, but the net hood of the bivy would ensure a bug-free night.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071522741/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6071522741_0912fc41b9_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Camp"></a>\r\n\r\nThat night I was awoken by some clomping off to the south of camp. Something larger than a mouse, but smaller than a Sasquatch.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning I broke camp upon waking, wanting to get someplace higher and breezier than buggy Lake Mary before breakfast.\r\n\r\nPast the lake, the trail climbs to Mary\'s Pass. As I walked, I watched the sun\'s rays creep over the eastern ridge and brighten the lower valley. Marmots scampered down the trail, and the mosquitoes continued to buzz.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071536025/" title="Sunrise above Mary Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6079/6071536025_5f6cfcc5e9_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Sunrise above Mary Pass"></a>\r\n\r\nAt the top of the pass the world opens up. There is a sea of mountains in all directions, green carpeted valleys emanating from their depths, and the blue sky above. I\'ve spent a lot of times in the mountains. This spot, on this day, is one of the most beautiful that I\'ve seen. I cannot capture it.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072115744/" title="Ladies Pass and Cape Horn by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6072115744_4441a46479_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Ladies Pass and Cape Horn"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071578041/" title="Icicle Ridge High Country by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6071578041_6de05345e8_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Icicle Ridge High Country"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072141098/" title="Cape Horn by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6072141098_fa8a6f7f71_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Cape Horn"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072154642/" title="East Face of Cape Horn by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6072154642_1c2c0916ef_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="East Face of Cape Horn"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072171796/" title="Lake Edna by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6072171796_867478a170_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lake Edna"></a>\r\n\r\nI ate breakfast above the pass, and spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon rambling around the alpine wonderland. I explored some of the valleys and lakes down below, climbed back up the ridges and scrambled to the top of the peaks. Towards the late afternoon I decided it was time to leave. I wanted to retrace my steps from earlier in the morning and the previous afternoon, dropping back over Frosty Pass before climbing up to Lake Grace on the other side of Snowgrass Mountain. I had seen the beginning of the trail that led to the lake on the hike in. It wasn\'t marked on either of my maps, and I curious to see what was up there.\r\n\r\nSoon after I started on the Lake Grace trail it became evident that it was little used. It was even more overgrown than the Wildhorse Creek trail and, in spots, had been completely wiped out by avalanches. There were occasional cairns stacked along the route, but they soon died out as I discovered their source. About a quarter mile ahead there was a group of three, slowly plodding down the trail. As I approached their leader commented that I looked like I knew where I was going. "Nope," I replied. "Never been here before." He had been stacking the cairns occasionally, as he found what looked like it might be a trail. They were a slow moving group, with large packs, so I darted on ahead, exploring the route and backtracking to find them when I had located what I thought was the official trail. In that manner we slowly made it to a small meadow with many creeks running through it. Above, a waterfall fell down the face of a cliff. The basin above must hold our lake, we reasoned, and prepared ourselves for the climb.\r\n\r\nI aimed straight up and began a slow steady plod. The others, wishing to mark the actual trail rather than my adhoc route, took a longer route, slowly searching for the remnants of switchbacks. I soon left them behind and climbed the face alone.\r\n\r\nAt the top was a green meadow strewn with large boulders. I weaved through them, making my way deeper into the basin, soon discovering three lakes: Lake Grace, a second unnamed lake, and a third that was likely just a seasonal puddle of snow melt.

    vellum_post_9.body_rendered = u'<p>Continuing with my recent theme of short, low-mileage trips I ventured back into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness last weekend. After hitting snow at low elevations at the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2011/08/14/yonder-alpine-lakes/">Foss Lakes the previous week</a>, I decided this time to head east of the crest.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072004460/" title="Entering the Alpine Lakes by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6072004460_cb6bcdba7f_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Entering the Alpine Lakes" /></a></p>\n<p>Whitepine Creek runs just west of Leavenworth and provides a lesser known and lesser used route onto Icicle Ridge and the surrounding area, compared to the popular Icicle Creek Road. I reached the nearest trailhead at midmorning on Friday. As I pulled my pack out of the car, I realized something was missing. Whoops, no trekking pole! I only ever carry one pole anymore, and don&#8217;t find it to be required gear for walking. Its import lies in the fact that I use it to set up my tarp. The pole isn&#8217;t needed when I string up the tarp between two trees &#8212; which I prefer to do whenever two conveniently placed trees present themselves at my intended camp &#8212; but I would be getting high on this trip and thought it likely that I would be spending a night or two above tree line.</p>\n<p>Near the trailhead&#8217;s bulletin board I spotted a few walking sticks leaning against a stump. Throwing the pack on my back, I walked over to the sticks and inspected the lot for one that would suit me. I found one that was light and skinny, but still strong enough to serve for any swift stream crossings that may lay ahead. It was a good height for walking, which meant it was too tall for the front beak of the tarp. I could cut it down to size later.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071456355/" title="Whitepine Trailhead by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6071456355_dd0b7016eb_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Whitepine Trailhead" /></a></p>\n<p>With stick in hand, I headed out. The trail leads into the Whitepine valley, filled with thick pine woods which provide shade from the morning sun. Occasionally, I caught a glimpse of the valley ridge above. At two and a half miles, I reached a junction with Wildhorse creek, which drains into Whitepine on its way out of the mountains. I took a left and began the climb up the Wildhorse valley, to its head at Frosty Pass and the high country beyond.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072010242/" title="Whitepine Valley by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6072010242_13fc763465_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Whitepine Valley" /></a></p>\n<p>The Whitepine and the Wildhorse sit in the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chiwaukum_Mountains">Chiwaukum Mountains</a>, which in Wenatchee means <em>many-little-creeks-leading-together</em>. True to form, dozens of small creeks flow down the otherwise dry eastern ridge of the Wildhorse, turning it into a wet hike. In places the trail was a creek. In others, the small amount of use and large amount of moisture had created thick patches of salmon berry and devil&#8217;s club that obscured the trail. I push through it, hoping that I&#8217;m the only one walking through this berry feast at the moment.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072016052/" title="A Thick Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6072016052_193b5e37bd_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="A Thick Trail" /></a></p>\n<p>As the trail lead higher, the trees began to thin and the views along the opposite ridge reveal high peaks and green fields.</p>\n<p>With wet, muddy feet I reached Frosty Pass sometime in mid-afternoon., around 10 miles and a few thousand feet of elevation from the trail head. The sun is strong. The weather forecast called for 90&deg;F down below. It doesn&#8217;t feel much cooler up here.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071501439/" title="Frosty Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6071501439_be45b5d03b_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Frosty Pass" /></a></p>\n<p>From Frosty Pass, my route headed directly east and climbed up to Icicle Ridge. Shortly, I reached the first of the ridge&#8217;s lakes, Lake Mary, which was my destination for the day.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071511595/" title="Above Lake Mary by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6071511595_ef54158508_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Above Lake Mary" /></a></p>\n<p>In the time that it took to set my pack down and take a drink of water, I had dozens of mosquitos biting my skin. I was ready for them this time, after having a similar experience last week. Rain pants, rain jacket, hat, headnet and gloves all came out of my pack. I soon was protected inside a sweaty bug suit.</p>\n<p>I tied my tarp up between a couple trees, avoiding having to cut my walking stick down to length for a front pole. Below the tarp, went my bivy sack. Rain didn&#8217;t seem likely, but the net hood of the bivy would ensure a bug-free night.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071522741/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6071522741_0912fc41b9_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>That night I was awoken by some clomping off to the south of camp. Something larger than a mouse, but smaller than a Sasquatch.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning I broke camp upon waking, wanting to get someplace higher and breezier than buggy Lake Mary before breakfast.</p>\n<p>Past the lake, the trail climbs to Mary&#8217;s Pass. As I walked, I watched the sun&#8217;s rays creep over the eastern ridge and brighten the lower valley. Marmots scampered down the trail, and the mosquitoes continued to buzz.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071536025/" title="Sunrise above Mary Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6079/6071536025_5f6cfcc5e9_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Sunrise above Mary Pass" /></a></p>\n<p>At the top of the pass the world opens up. There is a sea of mountains in all directions, green carpeted valleys emanating from their depths, and the blue sky above. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of times in the mountains. This spot, on this day, is one of the most beautiful that I&#8217;ve seen. I cannot capture it.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072115744/" title="Ladies Pass and Cape Horn by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6072115744_4441a46479_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Ladies Pass and Cape Horn" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6071578041/" title="Icicle Ridge High Country by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6071578041_6de05345e8_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Icicle Ridge High Country" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072141098/" title="Cape Horn by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6072141098_fa8a6f7f71_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Cape Horn" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072154642/" title="East Face of Cape Horn by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6072154642_1c2c0916ef_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="East Face of Cape Horn" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072171796/" title="Lake Edna by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6072171796_867478a170_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lake Edna" /></a></p>\n<p>I ate breakfast above the pass, and spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon rambling around the alpine wonderland. I explored some of the valleys and lakes down below, climbed back up the ridges and scrambled to the top of the peaks. Towards the late afternoon I decided it was time to leave. I wanted to retrace my steps from earlier in the morning and the previous afternoon, dropping back over Frosty Pass before climbing up to Lake Grace on the other side of Snowgrass Mountain. I had seen the beginning of the trail that led to the lake on the hike in. It wasn&#8217;t marked on either of my maps, and I curious to see what was up there.</p>\n<p>Soon after I started on the Lake Grace trail it became evident that it was little used. It was even more overgrown than the Wildhorse Creek trail and, in spots, had been completely wiped out by avalanches. There were occasional cairns stacked along the route, but they soon died out as I discovered their source. About a quarter mile ahead there was a group of three, slowly plodding down the trail. As I approached their leader commented that I looked like I knew where I was going. &#8220;Nope,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Never been here before.&#8221; He had been stacking the cairns occasionally, as he found what looked like it might be a trail. They were a slow moving group, with large packs, so I darted on ahead, exploring the route and backtracking to find them when I had located what I thought was the official trail. In that manner we slowly made it to a small meadow with many creeks running through it. Above, a waterfall fell down the face of a cliff. The basin above must hold our lake, we reasoned, and prepared ourselves for the climb.</p>\n<p>I aimed straight up and began a slow steady plod. The others, wishing to mark the actual trail rather than my adhoc route, took a longer route, slowly searching for the remnants of switchbacks. I soon left them behind and climbed the face alone.</p>\n<p>At the top was a green meadow strewn with large boulders. I weaved through them, making my way deeper into the basin, soon discovering three lakes: Lake Grace, a second unnamed lake, and a third that was likely just a seasonal puddle of snow melt. Having found our destination, I went back through the boulders and climbed down a couple hundred feet till I was within shouting distance of the others. I wanted to make sure they knew where the lakes lay and had an idea about the rest of the route. This accomplished, I climbed up again and re-entered the basin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6072192448/" title="Lake Grace by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6072192448_940f37f7bd_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lake Grace" /></a></p>\n<p>The lakes were surrounded by rough meadows covered with heather and other such small shrubs.

On the other side, the ridge fell to reveal Jack Creek, Mount Stuart and the other paths I had traveled [the year before](http://pig-monkey.com/2010/09/25/equinox-in-the-stuart-range/). It\'s pleasing to see that country again, and I gaze off into the Wilderness as I recall some of the moments of that past trip. I\'m also satisfied that my route finding had gone perfectly to plan.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6018845559/" title="Jack Creek by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6008/6018845559_23c15c28c1_b.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Jack Creek"></a>\r\n\r\nLast night, camped back beyond Lake Anne, I had taken out map and compass and, while dinner sat in the cozy, planned today\'s route. The cross country section was only a couple miles, but I find it useful to plan carefully, whether the route is two miles or 20.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6018780243/" title="Route Planning by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6016/6018780243_b20ecbe7d0_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Route Planning"></a>\r\n\r\nI had come in on the De Roux trailhead, which climbed up a ways from the Teanaway valley before reaching Gallagher Head Lake. My plans for this piece of rambling were uncertain. I had an idea or two, but no certain plan. Summer was late this year. I wasn\'t sure what sort of snow I would hit, or where. Whatever conditions I did meet would factor into determining my route.\r\n\r\nAt Gallagher I met a couple who had camped the previous night at Lake Anne. We greeted one another and they asked where I was headed. "Up Ingalls way," I said, with a vague waving of the hand. I told them that I knew I was heading to Lake Anne, and then from there I\'d leave the trail, heading toward Ingalls Peak, to see what I would see.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019269246/" title="Gallgher Head Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/6019269246_555c1f94de_b.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Gallgher Head Lake"></a>\r\n\r\nAfter lunch at the lake, I continued down the trail, making my way north and west to the other side of Esmeralda Peaks.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6018733565/" title="Along the Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/6018733565_831653d7d6_b.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Along the Trail"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6018727499/" title="Moon Above Esmeralda Peaks by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/6018727499_9be5b013c4_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Moon Above Esmeralda Peaks"></a>\r\n\r\nSouth of Anne Lake, I decided to make a late afternoon camp. I went off the trail aways and found a spot just on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Esmeralda basin. With the tarp pitched, I wandered down to a small creek for water. There, I had dinner, as well, before climbing back up to where I had made camp.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019312814/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6122/6019312814_68d55ee455_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Camp"></a>\r\n\r\nThe long summer evening gave me plenty of time to take in the view and. That night, there were thousands of stars that needed gazing.\r\n\r\nThe following morning I had broken camp and climbed over the final saddle to Lake Anne. From there, I left the trail, aiming for an unnamed pass just north of Ingalls Peak. My intention was to climb over that, descend into the Jack Creek valley, and then climb back up to Stuart Pass. From there, I would go to Lake Ingalls and head back down, effectively circumnavigating the peak.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019374222/" title="Toward the Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6142/6019374222_9b8fd1269b_b.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Toward the Pass"></a>\r\n\r\nAfter enjoying the view at the top of the pass, I turned to the more immediate matter of the descent. The east side of the ridge was steeper than the west, and covered with crumbling talus. I tried three different ways down, but on all them I eventually had to turn around and climb back up. I try not to climb down anything I can\'t climb up. Some rope and hardware would have been handy, but I had none. I had packed my ice ax, thinking it likely that there would be more snow here at 7,000 feet, but, except for the occasional small field, it was melted. Had I come a week or two earlier, most of the ridge probably would have been snow covered, which would have made the descent simpler. As it was, no route presented itself. I decided that instead of making Lake Ingalls, I would retrace my steps to last night\'s camp and head down and out along Esmeralda Basin.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019409222/" title="A Descent by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/6019409222_2271179158_b.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="A Descent"></a>\r\n\r\nFirst, though, came lunch.

My plans for this piece of rambling were uncertain. I had an idea or two, but no certain plan. Summer was late this year. I wasn&#8217;t sure what sort of snow I would hit, or where. Whatever conditions I did meet would factor into determining my route.</p>\n<p>At Gallagher I met a couple who had camped the previous night at Lake Anne. We greeted one another and they asked where I was headed. &#8220;Up Ingalls way,&#8221; I said, with a vague waving of the hand. I told them that I knew I was heading to Lake Anne, and then from there I&#8217;d leave the trail, heading toward Ingalls Peak, to see what I would see.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019269246/" title="Gallgher Head Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/6019269246_555c1f94de_b.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Gallgher Head Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>After lunch at the lake, I continued down the trail, making my way north and west to the other side of Esmeralda Peaks.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6018733565/" title="Along the Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6137/6018733565_831653d7d6_b.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Along the Trail" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6018727499/" title="Moon Above Esmeralda Peaks by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6132/6018727499_9be5b013c4_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Moon Above Esmeralda Peaks" /></a></p>\n<p>South of Anne Lake, I decided to make a late afternoon camp. I went off the trail aways and found a spot just on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Esmeralda basin. With the tarp pitched, I wandered down to a small creek for water. There, I had dinner, as well, before climbing back up to where I had made camp.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019312814/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6122/6019312814_68d55ee455_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>The long summer evening gave me plenty of time to take in the view and. That night, there were thousands of stars that needed gazing.</p>\n<p>The following morning I had broken camp and climbed over the final saddle to Lake Anne. From there, I left the trail, aiming for an unnamed pass just north of Ingalls Peak. My intention was to climb over that, descend into the Jack Creek valley, and then climb back up to Stuart Pass. From there, I would go to Lake Ingalls and head back down, effectively circumnavigating the peak.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019374222/" title="Toward the Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6142/6019374222_9b8fd1269b_b.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Toward the Pass" /></a></p>\n<p>After enjoying the view at the top of the pass, I turned to the more immediate matter of the descent. The east side of the ridge was steeper than the west, and covered with crumbling talus. I tried three different ways down, but on all them I eventually had to turn around and climb back up. I try not to climb down anything I can&#8217;t climb up. Some rope and hardware would have been handy, but I had none. I had packed my ice ax, thinking it likely that there would be more snow here at 7,000 feet, but, except for the occasional small field, it was melted. Had I come a week or two earlier, most of the ridge probably would have been snow covered, which would have made the descent simpler. As it was, no route presented itself. I decided that instead of making Lake Ingalls, I would retrace my steps to last night&#8217;s camp and head down and out along Esmeralda Basin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/6019409222/" title="A Descent by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/6019409222_2271179158_b.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="A Descent" /></a></p>\n<p>First, though, came lunch.

We wanted fire, but neither of us had brought any dry wood into our shelters the night before. Everything was soaked.\r\n\r\nWe gathered what we could -- branches from dead fall that were up off the ground, as well as dead lower branches from standing trees -- but the trees were so sparse in the area that, even after splitting, much of this wood was still wet. (I should mention that we *wanted* a fire, but did not *need* one. I, at least, was not hugely motivated to put a large amount of energy into batoning. So a small amount of our failure ought to be attributed to laziness.)\r\n\r\nAfter failing to get a blaze going with the wet wood, even after using a bit of [inner tube](http://pig-monkey.com/tags/inner-tube/) to extend the flame, I hit on the idea of using the Inferno.\r\n\r\nI\'ve had my [Trail Designs Ti-Tri](http://pig-monkey.com/2009/01/18/trail-designs-ti-tri-titanium-stove-system/) for two and a half years now. It\'s been my primary stove system for all of that time. Last Fall, I contacted [Trail Designs](http://www.traildesigns.com/) and had them send me an Inferno insert for the system. The Inferno consists of a second, inverted cone and a grate. The grate raises the base of the fire up off of the ground, allowing for an improved air flow, and the second cone creates a double-walled stove. This turns the Ti-Tri into a wood gassifier, similar to the [Four Dogs Bushcooker](http://www.fourdog.com/index_files/bushcooker.htm) or the ever-popular [Bushbuddy](http://www.bushbuddy.ca/).\r\n\r\nSo, back at camp, I thought the Inferno might help. I had never used it before solely to start a camp fire, but I knew from previous experience using it to cook my dinner that it was efficient enough to burn damp wood. It would give us a raised platform, allowing us to build the fire up off of the saturated ground, and the cone would provide a wall to keep the heat in and help dry the wood.\r\n\r\nIt was a success.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5988142560/" title="Inferno Fire by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5988142560_5484a71358_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Inferno Fire"></a>\r\n\r\nWe split a bit more wood, and did a bit more feathering. It was all still as damp as before, but shortly we achieved a small blaze inside the Inferno. From there, it was simply a matter of building the fire up and around the Inferno. With the heat put out by the cone, even the wet, unprocessed wood would dry and burn. As the fire built up, the Inferno could be pulled out with a multi-tool or a couple sticks, and packed away with the rest of the Ti-Tri, ready to cook the next meal.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the Inferno insert varies. It is dependent on the size of the outer Caldera cone, which in turns varies based on the size of the pot. For my system, which is built around a 900mL pot from [Titanium Goat](http://titaniumgoat.com/), the pieces that comprise the Inferno weigh in at a collective 38 grams (1.34 ounces). Given that it not only increases the Ti-Tri\'s efficiency as a wood burning stove, but also functions as an emergency fire starter, I\'m happy to haul the extra weight.'

    vellum_post_15.body = u'Three years ago I wrote [a guide to building a VPS web server](http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-basic-setup/) for serving sites in a PHP environment. That setup served me well for some time, but most of the sites I run now -- [including this one](http://pig-monkey.com/2011/06/11/move-django/) -- are now written in Python. Earlier this year I built another web server to reflect this. It\'s similar to before; I still use Ubuntu and I still like to serve pages with nginx. But PHP has been replaced with Python, and many of the packages used to build the environment have changed as a result. As with the last time, I decided to compile my notes into a guide, both for my own reference and in case anyone else would like to duplicate it. So far, the server has proven to be fast and efficient. It serves Python using uWSGI, uses a PostgreSQL database, and includes a simple mail server provided by Postfix. I think it\'s a good setup for serving simple Django-based websites.\r\n\r\nBasic Setup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n[As with last time](http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-basic-setup), I recommend following [Slicehost\'s basic server setup article](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/4/30/ubuntu-lucid-setup-part-1). It discusses user administration, SSH security, and firewalls. I no longer use Slicehost as my VPS provider, but I find that Slicehost\'s articles provide an excellent base regardless of the host.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Packages\r\n\r\nPackages should upgraded immediately to address any known security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo apt-get update\r\n    $ sudo apt-get upgrade\r\n\r\nAfter the repositories have been updated, I install some essential packages.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential screen dnsutils\r\n\r\n[Build-essential](http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/build-essential) includes necessary tools to compile programs. I am incapable of using a computer that does not have [screen](http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/screen) on it, so that gets installed too. The third package, [dnsutils](http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/dnsutils), is optional, but includes `dig` which is useful for troubleshooting DNS issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n###DenyHosts\r\n\r\nSlicehost\'s setup article recommends turning off password authentication in SSH, forcing users to login with keys only. I use keys whenever I can, but I appreciate the option of being able to login to my server from any computer, when I may or may not have my SSH key with me. So I leave password authentication enabled. This presents the possibility of brute-force attacks. Enter [DenyHosts](http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/). DenyHosts, which I have [discussed previously](http://pig-monkey.com/2008/10/03/thoughts-on-ssh-security/) attempts to protect against SSH attacks by banning hosts after a certain number of failed login attempts. When password authentication is enabled, running DenyHosts is a smart move.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install denyhosts\r\n    $ sudo vim /etc/denyhosts.conf\r\n\r\n\r\n###Personalize the Environment\r\n\r\nI use `update-alternatives` to set my default editor to [vim](http://www.vim.org).\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo update-alternatives --config editor\r\n\r\nAll of my personal configuration files are kept in a [github repository](https://github.com/pigmonkey/dotfiles). I\'ll check out that repository into `~/src` and install the files.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ mkdir ~/src\r\n    $ cd ~/src\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install git-core\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/pigmonkey/dotfiles.git\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bash_colors ~/.bash_colors\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim\r\n    $ ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/screenrc ~/.screenrc\r\n    $ source ~/.bash_profile\r\n\r\n\r\n###Time\r\n\r\nThe next step is to set the server\'s timezone and sync the clock with [NTP](http://www.ntp.org).\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install ntp\r\n\r\n\r\n###Rootkits\r\n\r\nThere\'s no reason not to run both [chkrootkit](http://www.chkrootkit.org/) and [rkhunter](http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net) to check for rootkits and related vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n####chrkrootkit\r\n\r\nSlicehost has [an excellent article for setting up and using chkrootkit](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/3/24/scanning-for-rootkits-with-chkrootkit-updated).\r\n\r\nLater on I\'ll be installing some Python development packages. One of them creates a directory called `/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/.path`, which sets off a warning in chkrootkit. Part of chkrootkit\'s desgin philosophy is to not include any whitelists: if chkrootkit finds something that it doesn\'t like, you\'re going to hear about it. I have cron run chkrootkit nightly and I want to receive any warnings, but I don\'t want to receive the same false positive every morning in my inbox.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to create a file that contains chkrootkit\'s warning. I call that file `whitelist` and store it in the same directory as chkrootkit. When chkrootkit is run, any output is redirected to a file. That file is compared to the whitelist using `diff` and the output *of that* -- if any -- is then read. At the end, the file containing chkrootkit\'s output is deleted so that the working directory is ready for the next run. The effect is that I only hear warnings from chkrootkit that I *have not explicit whitelisted*. All of this can be accomplished in a single crontab entry.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    0 3 * * * (cd /home/demo/src/chkrootkit-0.49; ./chkrootkit -q > message 2>&1; diff -w whitelist message; rm -f message)\r\n\r\n\r\n####rkhunter\r\n\r\nI\'m sure it doesn\'t surprise you that I\'m going to recommend reading Slicehost\'s [article on rkhunter](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/3/24/scanning-for-rootkits-with-rkhunter-updated).\r\n\r\nUnlike chkrootkit, rkhunter does allow for whitelists. On a clean Ubuntu 10.04 system, I find that I need to whitelist a few items in the config.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo vim /etc/rkhunter.conf\r\n\r\n    SCRIPTWHITELIST="/usr/sbin/adduser /usr/bin/ldd /bin/which"\r\n    ALLOWHIDDENDIR="/dev/.udev /dev/.initramfs"\r\n    APP_WHITELIST="openssl:0.9.8k gpg:1.4.10"\r\n\r\n    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --propupd\r\n\r\nThe script that my cronjob runs is slightly different from the one demonstrated in the Slicehost article. Their script executes a few commands, groups the output together, and sends it to `mail` to email the system administrator. This results in daily emails, regardless of whether rkhunter finds any warnings or not. My script is simpler and does not result in so many messages.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    #!/bin/sh\r\n    /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --versioncheck -q\r\n    /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --update -q\r\n    /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --cronjob --report-warnings-only\r\n\r\nThe version check and update commands both have the `-q` switch, which disables any output -- I don\'t care to know whether rkhunter updated itself or not. The final line actually executes the scan. Notice that there\'s no reference to `mail`. This script does not send any messages. The reason for that is that rkhunter itself provides the mail functionality. Inside of `/etc/rkhunter.conf` there is a `MAIL-ON-WARNING` variable. As long as the machine has an smtp server on it (which I\'ll get to later in this guide), simply filling in this variable will result in any warnings being emailed to the system administrator.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb Server\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWith the basics complete, it\'s time to start serving something! In my [previous article](http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-web-server/) I covered serving a PHP-based Wordpress site via FastCGI and nginx. This time around the stack will be different: [nginx](http://nginx.org/), [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/), [Python](http://www.python.org/), and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/).\r\n\r\nA few basic packages will help flesh out the server\'s Python development environment:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-setuptools python2.6-dev psmisc python-imaging locate python-dateutil libxml2-dev python-software-properties\r\n\r\n\r\n###uWSGI\r\n\r\nInstalling [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/) is a simple matter of compiling it and moving the resulting binary into one of your system\'s bin directories.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd ~/src/\r\n    $ wget http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/uwsgi-0.9.8.tar.gz\r\n    $ tar xvzf ~/uwsgi-0.9.8.tar.gz \r\n    $ cd uwsgi-0.9.8/\r\n    $ make -f Makefile.Py26\r\n    $ sudo cp uwsgi /usr/local/sbin\r\n\r\n\r\n###nginx\r\n\r\nThe [nginx](http://nginx.org/) package in Ubuntu\'s official repositories is always notoriously outdated. It used to be you had to compile the server from source, but there is now an [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas) for the latest stable versions. [As described by the nginx wiki](http://wiki.nginx.org/Install#Ubuntu_PPA), all that is needed is to add the PPA to your `sources.list` and `apt-get` away!\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable\r\n    $ sudo apt-get update \r\n    $ sudo apt-get install nginx\r\n\r\n\r\n###Python and Django\r\n\r\nIf you do Python development and haven\'t heard of [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv), it is well worth reading up on. It allows the user to create an isolated, virtual Python environment for each project. This helps immensely when developing (or serving) multiple projects on a single machine. Needless to say, I consider it to be a required package.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Install\r\n\r\nI\'ll be installing virtualenv and [virtualenvwrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper) (a set of scripts to facilitate working with virtual environments). I also prefer [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) over `easy_install` for managing Python packages.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo easy_install -U pip \r\n    $ sudo pip install virtualenv\r\n    $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper\r\n\r\n\r\n####Setup a virtual environment\r\n\r\nVirtual environments can be stored wherever you fancy. For now, I keep them in a hidden folder in my home directory. For these examples, I\'ll setup an environment called `myproject`.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs\r\n    $ cd ~/.virtualenvs\r\n    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute myproject\r\n\r\nNotice the `--no-site-packages` switch. That tells `virtualenv` to create this environment without any of the Python packages already installed, creating a completely fresh, clean environment. The `--distribute` switch causes the new virtual environment to be setup with [distribute](http://packages.python.org/distribute/), a replacement for the old and rather broken [setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).\r\n\r\nAll that\'s needed to get `virtualenvwrapper` up and running is to add two lines to your `.bashrc` and re-source the file.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ vim ~/.bashrc\r\n    \r\n    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\r\n    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\r\n    \r\n    $ . ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\nWe can now use commands like `workon` to ease the process of activating a certain environment.\r\n\r\nI\'ll go ahead and install [yolk](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yolk) in the environment to help manage packages.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ workon myproject\r\n    $ pip install yolk\r\n    $ yolk -l\r\n\r\nThe last command will cause `yolk` to list all packages installed in the environment. Try deactivating the environment and then running `yolk` again.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ deactivate\r\n    $ yolk -l\r\n    yolk: command not found\r\n\r\n\'yolk\' wasn\'t found, because it was only installed within the virtual environment. Neat!\r\n\r\n\r\n####Install Django\r\n\r\nFinally, it\'s time to install Django! The process is simple enough.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ workon myproject\r\n    $ pip install django\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s it!\r\n\r\nThe [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) is likely to be needed for any Django project. I installed it in the beginning of this section, but because I used the `--no-site-packages` when creating my virtual environment, it is not available for use within the project. To fix that, I\'ll just link the package in. I also previously installed [psyopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/), which Python will need to communicate with my PostgreSQL database, so I\'ll link that in as well. `psyopg2` depends on [mx](http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/), which was also previously installed but still must be made available in the environment.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cdsitepackages\r\n    $ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PIL\r\n    $ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PIL.pth\r\n    $ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/psycopg2\r\n    $ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/mx\r\n\r\nThat wasn\'t too painful!\r\n\r\n\r\n####Create a Django project\r\n\r\nWhile I\'m still in the virtual environment, I\'ll go ahead and create a new Django project. The project will have the same name as the environment: `myproject`. For this tutorial, I\'ll stick with the precedence set by the Slicehost tutorials and use `demo` as the name of both my user and group on the server.\r\n\r\nI like to keep my sites in the `/srv/` directory. I structure them so that the code that runs the site, any public files, logs, and backups are all stored in separate sub-directories.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd /srv/\r\n    $ sudo mkdir -p myproject.com/{code,public,logs,backup}\r\n    $ sudo mkdir -p myproject.com/public/{media,static}\r\n    $ sudo chown -R demo:demo myproject.com\r\n    $ cd myproject.com\r\n    $ sudo chown -R :www-data logs public\r\n    $ sudo chmod -R g+w logs public\r\n    $ cd code/\r\n    $ django-admin.py startproject myproject\r\n\r\nNotice that the `logs` and `public` directories were `chown`ed to the www-data group. That is the name of the user and group that nginx will run as. The web server will need permissions to write to those locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Save Requirements\r\n\r\nWith the environment setup and all the necessary packages installed, now is a good time to tell pip to [freeze](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/#freezing-requirements) all the packages and their versions. I keep this file in a `deploy` folder in my project.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ mkdir /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy\r\n    $ pip freeze > /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/requirements.txt\r\n\r\nNow, if I needed to recreate the virtual environment somewhere else, I could just tell pip to install all the packages from that file.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ pip install -r /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/requirements.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n###Configure uWSGI\r\n\r\nNow that I have something to serve, I\'ll configure uWSGI to serve it. The first step is to create a configuration file for the project. I call mine `wsgi.py` and store it in `/srv/myproject.com/code/myproject/`. It appends the current directory to the Python path, specifies the Django settings file for the project, and registers the WSGI handler.\r\n\r\n    #!python\r\n    import sys\r\n    import os\r\n    \r\n    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)))\r\n    os.environ[\'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\'] = \'myproject.settings\'\r\n    \r\n    import django.core.handlers.wsgi\r\n    \r\n    application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()\r\n\r\nWith that done, the next step is to decide how uWSGI should be run. I\'m going to use Ubuntu\'s [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) to supervise the service. I keep the upstart script in my project\'s `deploy/` directory.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ vim /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/uwsgi.conf\r\n\r\n    description "uWSGI server for My Project"\r\n    \r\n    start on runlevel [2345]\r\n    stop on runlevel [!2345]\r\n    \r\n    respawn\r\n    exec /usr/local/sbin/uwsgi \\\r\n    --home /home/demo/.virtualenvs/myproject/ \\\r\n    --socket /var/run/myproject.com.sock \\\r\n    --chmod-socket \\\r\n    --pythonpath /srv/myproject.com/code/ \\\r\n    --module myproject.wsgi \\\r\n    --process 2 \\\r\n    --harakiri 30 \\\r\n    --master \\\r\n    --logto /srv/myproject.com/logs/uwsgi.log\r\n\r\nSadly, upstart doesn\'t seem to recognize links. Rather than linking the config file into `/etc/init/`, I have to copy it.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo cp /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/uwsgi.conf /etc/init/uwsgi-myproject.conf\r\n\r\n\r\n###Configure nginx\r\n\r\nNginx\'s configuration is pretty straight-forward. If you\'ve never configured the server before, [Slicehost\'s articles](http://articles.slicehost.com/nginx) can set you down the right path. My own nginx config looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    user www-data www-data;\r\n    worker_processes 4;\r\n    pid /var/run/nginx.pid;\r\n    \r\n    events {\r\n            worker_connections 768;\r\n            use epoll;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    http {\r\n    \r\n        ##\r\n        # Basic Settings\r\n        ##\r\n        \r\n        sendfile on;\r\n        tcp_nopush on;\r\n        tcp_nodelay on;\r\n        keepalive_timeout 30;\r\n        types_hash_max_size 2048;\r\n        # server_tokens off;\r\n        \r\n        # server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;\r\n        # server_name_in_redirect off;\r\n        \r\n        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;\r\n        default_type application/octet-stream;\r\n        \r\n        ##\r\n        # Logging Settings\r\n        ##\r\n        \r\n        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;\r\n        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\r\n        \r\n        ##\r\n        # Gzip Settings\r\n        ##\r\n        \r\n        gzip on;\r\n        gzip_disable "msie6";\r\n        gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;\r\n        gzip_proxied any;\r\n        gzip_comp_level 2;\r\n        \r\n        # gzip_vary on;\r\n        # gzip_buffers 16 8k;\r\n        # gzip_http_version 1.1;\r\n        \r\n        ##\r\n        # Virtual Host Configs\r\n        ##\r\n        \r\n        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\r\n        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI keep the virtual host config for my project inside the project\'s `code/deploy/` directory. A basic virtual host for a Django project would looks like this:\r\n\r\n    server {\r\n        listen 80;\r\n        server_name www.myproject.com;\r\n        rewrite ^/(.*) http://myproject.com/$1 permanent;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    server {\r\n        listen 80;\r\n        server_name myproject.com;\r\n        \r\n        access_log /srv/myproject.com/logs/access.log;\r\n        error_log /srv/myproject.com/logs/error.log;\r\n        \r\n        location /media {\r\n            root /srv/myproject.com/public/;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        location /static {\r\n            root /srv/myproject.com/public/;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        location / {\r\n            uwsgi_pass unix:///var/run/myproject.com.sock;\r\n            include uwsgi_params;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo install and enable the virtual host, I\'ll link the configuration file first to the nginx `sites-available` directory, and then link that link to the `sites-enabled` directory.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo ln -s /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject.com\r\n    $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myproject.com\r\n\r\n\r\n###SSL\r\n\r\nIf you need to encrypt communications, [Linode has a tutorial](http://library.linode.com/web-servers/nginx/configuration/ssl) on using both self-signed certificates and commercial certificates with nginx.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Fire it Up\r\n\r\nNginx should be set to talk to uWSGI, which should be set to talk to the Django project. Time for a test run!\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo start uwsgi-myproject\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start\r\n\r\n\r\n###memcached\r\n\r\nDjango has a very good built-in [cache framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/). I like to take advantage of it with a memory-based backend: namely, [memcached](http://memcached.org/). It\'s fast, efficient, and easy to setup.\r\n\r\nAll that\'s needed is to install memcached on the server, followed by the Python API [python-memcached](http://www.tummy.com/Community/software/python-memcached/). \r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install memcached\r\n    $ workon myproject\r\n    $ pip install python-memcached\r\n\r\nThe default configuration file in Ubuntu lives at `/etc/memcached.conf`. I usually stick with the defaults, but sometimes end up changing the port that memchached runs on or the amount of memory it is allowed to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n###logrotate\r\n\r\nWith the web server more-or-less complete, I like to setup logrotate to manage the logs in my project\'s directory. Once again, Slicehost has [an excellent introduction to logrotate](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/6/30/understanding-logrotate-on-ubuntu-part-1) and [an example config for virtual hosts](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/6/30/understanding-logrotate-on-ubuntu-part-2).\r\n\r\nI maintain a configuration file for each of the domains being served by the machine. The file for a domain lives in -- you guessed it -- the associated project\'s `deploy/` folder. Each contains two entries: one for the nginx virtual host and one for the uWSGI instance. The reason for this is that each config block needs a `postrotate` section to restart the associated server after the logs have been rotated. I don\'t want nginx to be restarted everytime a uWSGI log is rotated, and I don\'t want uWSGI restarted everytime an nginx log is rotated.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ vim /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/logrotate\r\n\r\n    /srv/myproject.com/logs/access.log /srv/myproject.com/logs/error.log {\r\n        rotate 14\r\n        daily\r\n        compress\r\n        delaycompress\r\n        sharedscripts\r\n        postrotate\r\n            [ ! -f /var/run/nginx.pid ] || kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`\r\n        endscript\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /srv/myproject.com/logs/uwsgi.log {\r\n        rotate 14\r\n        daily\r\n        compress\r\n        delaycompress\r\n        postrotate\r\n           restart --quiet uwsgi-myproject\r\n        endscript\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis file is linked in to the `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory. Logrotate will automatically include any file in that directory inside its configuration.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo ln -s /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/myproject\r\n\r\n\r\nDatabase Server\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nA web server isn\'t much use without a database these days. I use [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\n###Install\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql\r\n\r\n\r\n###Configure\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL has some unique terminology and ways of doing things. When I first set it up for the first time, having coming from a MySQL background, not everything was completely straightforward. As usual, [Slicehost has a number of articles](http://articles.slicehost.com/postgresql) that will provide a foundation.\r\n\r\nIn the `/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf` file, I uncomment the following two lines:\r\n\r\n    track_counts = on\r\n    autovacuum = on\r\n\r\nThen restart the database server.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart\r\n\r\nAfter that I\'ll change the password for the postgres user and the postgres database role.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo passwd postgres\r\n    $ sudo -u postgres psql\r\n    \\password postgres\r\n    \\q\r\n\r\nTo allow local socket connections to the database using passwords, I open up `/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf` and find the following line:\r\n\r\n    local   all         all                               ident\r\n\r\nWhich I then change to:\r\n\r\n    local   all         all                               md5\r\n\r\nAfter which another restart is in order.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart\r\n\r\n\r\n###Create a database\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create a user (or role, in PostgreSQL\'s parlance) and database for the project. I use the same name for both.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo -u postgres createuser -PE myproject\r\n    $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O myproject myproject\r\n\r\nAfter that, I should be able to connect.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ psql -U myproject\r\n\r\n\r\n####Import the Database\r\n\r\nIf I\'m restoring a previous database from a backup, now would be the time to import the backup.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ psql -U myproject < myproject.postgresql\r\n\r\nAnd now Django should be able to connect!\r\n\r\nThe basic server is setup and secure. Django, uWSGI, nginx and PostgreSQL are all running and getting along swimmingly. At this point, many people would be done, but I also like to have a minimal mail server.\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Server\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nMost of my domains use [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/), so I don\'t need a full-blown mail server. I do want programs and scripts to be able to send mail, and I prefer not to do so through an external SMTP server -- I\'d rather just deal with having sendmail running on my own box. And I do have a few domains that do not use Google Apps. They have one or two aliases associated with them, so the server needs to receive messages for those domains and forward them off to an external address. If any of this sounds vaguely familiar, it\'s because it\'s the same thing I detailed [last time](http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-mail/). My setup now is the same as then, so I won\'t repeat any of it here.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed explanation of running [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/), you can [read the Slicehost articles](http://articles.slicehost.com/email).\r\n\r\n\r\nA Note on Git\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nI use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to keep track of the code for all my projects. (If you\'re new to Git, you ought to skim the [Git Reference](http://gitref.org/) or [Everyday GIT With 20 Commands Or So](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html)). To manage websites, I create a repository of the directory with the code that runs the site (in this case, `/srv/myproject.com/code/`) and another empty, bare repository to work as a hub. With a `post-update` and `post-commit`, the end result is an excellent web workflow:\r\n\r\n -  A copy of the hub can be checked out on a local machine for development. Whenever a change is committed, a simple `git push` will push the code to the web server and automatically make it live.\r\n - Changes can be made on the server in the actual live website directory. (This is not a best practice, but I do it more often than I should probably admit.) Whenever a change is committed, it is automatically pushed to the hub, so that a simple `git pull` is all that\'s needed on the development machine to update its repository.\r\n\r\nA more detailed explanation of this workflow is at [Joe Maller\'s blog](http://joemaller.com/990/a-web-focused-git-workflow/).\r\n\r\nTo start, I need to create a repository for the new project I created in this tutorial. And, since this is a new server, I need to give Git my name and email address to record with every commit.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ git config --global user.name "Pig Monkey"\r\n    $ git config --global user.email "pm@pig-monkey.com"\r\n    $ cd /srv/myproject.com/code/\r\n    $ git init\r\n\r\nBefore adding the files, I create a `.gitignore` file in the repository root to tell Git to ignore compiled Python files.\r\n\r\n    $ vim .gitignore\r\n    \r\n    *.pyc\r\n\r\nNow I add all the files to the repository, confirm that it worked, and commit the files.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ git add .\r\n    $ git status -s\r\n    $ git commit -m "Initial commit of myproject.com"\r\n\r\nI create the bare hub directory directly along side the projects `code/`.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd ../\r\n    $ mkdir hub.git\r\n    $ cd hub.git\r\n    $ git --bare init\r\n\r\nWith the hub created, I need to add it as the remote for the main repository and push the master branch to it.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd ../code\r\n    $ git remote add hub /srv/myproject.com/hub.git\r\n    $ git remote show hub\r\n    $ git push hub master\r\n\r\nNow the hub needs a `post-update` script so that every time something is pushed to it, that change is automagically pulled into the live website directory.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ vim /srv/myproject.com/hub.git/hooks/post-update\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/sh\r\n    echo\r\n    echo "**** Pulling changes into live"\r\n    echo\r\n\r\n    cd /srv/myproject.com/code || exit\r\n    unset GIT_DIR\r\n    git pull hub master\r\n    \r\n    exec git-update-server-info\r\n\r\n    $ chmod +x /srv/myproject.com/hub.git/hooks/post-update\r\n\r\nAnd the live website directory requires a `post-commit` script so that every time something is committed inside of it, that change is automagically pushed to the hub.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ vim /srv/myproject.com/code/.git/hooks/post-commit\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/sh\r\n    echo\r\n    echo "**** pushing changes to Hub"\r\n    echo\r\n    \r\n    git push hub\r\n    \r\n    $ chmod +x /srv/myproject.com/code/.git/hooks/post-commit\r\n\r\nAll that\'s left is to check out the hub onto the development machine -- my laptop, in this case!\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ mkdir ~/work/myproject/\r\n    $ cd ~/work/myproject/\r\n    $ git clone ssh://myserver.com/srv/myproject.com/hub.git code\r\n\r\nTo test things out, we can add a file to the repository on the development machine.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd code/\r\n    $ touch test\r\n    $ git add test\r\n    $ git commit -m "A test"\r\n    $ git push\r\n\r\nNow go back to the server, and the file should be there! To test things the other way around, I\'ll delete the file from the live repository.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd /srv/myproject.com/code/\r\n    $ ls\r\n    myproject test\r\n    $ git rm test\r\n    $ git commit -m "Removing the test file"\r\n\r\nAnd once again to the development machine:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ git pull\r\n    $ ls\r\n    deploy  myproject\r\n\r\nNo more test! It\'s pretty dandy.\r\n\r\n###Restoring\r\n\r\nIf I was building a new server and restoring a project from an old server, I would simply mirror the old hub and then clone that in the live directory.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd /srv/myproject.com/\r\n    $ git clone --mirror ssh://myoldserver.com/srv/myproject.com/hub.git\r\n    $ git clone hub.git code/\r\n\r\n\r\nResources\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nPrior to building this server, I was new to a lot of this -- particularly, uWSGI and virtualenv. The following tutorials helped me a good deal in putting together the perfect setup for my needs.\r\n\r\n - [A Primer on virtualenv](http://iamzed.com/2009/05/07/a-primer-on-virtualenv/) by Chris Scott\r\n - [A web-focused Git workflow](http://joemaller.com/990/a-web-focused-git-workflow/) by Joe Maller\r\n - [Deployment with uWSGI and nginx](http://blog.zacharyvoase.com/2010/03/05/django-uwsgi-nginx/) by Zachary Voase\r\n - [Django on uWSGI and Nginx](http://brandonkonkle.com/blog/2010/sep/14/django-uwsgi-and-nginx/) by Brandon Konkle\r\n - [Django, Nginx and uWSGI in production](http://www.jeremybowers.com/blog/post/5/django-nginx-and-uwsgi-production-serving-millions-page-views/) by Jeremy Bowers\r\n - [Notes on using pip and virtualenv with Django](http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/05/notes-using-pip-and-virtualenv-django/) by Eliot\r\n - [Presentation: pip and virtualenv](http://mathematism.com/2009/07/30/presentation-pip-and-virtualenv/) by Rich Leland\r\n - [Provisioning a new Ubuntu server for Django](http://brandonkonkle.com/blog/2010/jun/25/provisioning-new-ubuntu-server-django/) by Brandon Konkle\r\n - [Running Django with Nginx and uWSGI](http://www.westphahl.net/blog/2010/4/8/running-django-nginx-and-uwsgi/) by Simon Westphahl\r\n - [virtualenvwrapper Command Reference](http://www.doughellmann.com/docs/virtualenvwrapper/command_ref.html)\r\n - [Working with virtualenv](http://www.arthurkoziel.com/2008/10/22/working-virtualenv/) by Arthur Koziel'
    vellum_post_15.body_rendered = u'<p>Three years ago I wrote <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-basic-setup/">a guide to building a VPS web server</a> for serving sites in a PHP environment. That setup served me well for some time, but most of the sites I run now &#8212; <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2011/06/11/move-django/">including this one</a> &#8212; are now written in Python. Earlier this year I built another web server to reflect this. It&#8217;s similar to before; I still use Ubuntu and I still like to serve pages with nginx. But PHP has been replaced with Python, and many of the packages used to build the environment have changed as a result. As with the last time, I decided to compile my notes into a guide, both for my own reference and in case anyone else would like to duplicate it. So far, the server has proven to be fast and efficient. It serves Python using uWSGI, uses a PostgreSQL database, and includes a simple mail server provided by Postfix. I think it&#8217;s a good setup for serving simple Django-based websites.</p>\n<h2>Basic Setup</h2>\n<p><a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-basic-setup">As with last time</a>, I recommend following <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/4/30/ubuntu-lucid-setup-part-1">Slicehost&#8217;s basic server setup article</a>. It discusses user administration, SSH security, and firewalls. I no longer use Slicehost as my VPS provider, but I find that Slicehost&#8217;s articles provide an excellent base regardless of the host.</p>\n<h3>Packages</h3>\n<p>Packages should upgraded immediately to address any known security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get update\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get upgrade\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>After the repositories have been updated, I install some essential packages.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install build-essential screen dnsutils\n</pre></div>\n\n<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/build-essential">Build-essential</a> includes necessary tools to compile programs. I am incapable of using a computer that does not have <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/screen">screen</a> on it, so that gets installed too. The third package, <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/dnsutils">dnsutils</a>, is optional, but includes <code>dig</code> which is useful for troubleshooting DNS issues.</p>\n<h3>DenyHosts</h3>\n<p>Slicehost&#8217;s setup article recommends turning off password authentication in SSH, forcing users to login with keys only. I use keys whenever I can, but I appreciate the option of being able to login to my server from any computer, when I may or may not have my SSH key with me. So I leave password authentication enabled. This presents the possibility of brute-force attacks. Enter <a href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">DenyHosts</a>. DenyHosts, which I have <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/10/03/thoughts-on-ssh-security/">discussed previously</a> attempts to protect against SSH attacks by banning hosts after a certain number of failed login attempts. When password authentication is enabled, running DenyHosts is a smart move.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install denyhosts\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo vim /etc/denyhosts.conf\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Personalize the Environment</h3>\n<p>I use <code>update-alternatives</code> to set my default editor to <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo update-alternatives --config editor\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>All of my personal configuration files are kept in a <a href="https://github.com/pigmonkey/dotfiles">github repository</a>. I&#8217;ll check out that repository into <code>~/src</code> and install the files.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir ~/src\n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/src\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install git-core\n<span class="nv">$ </span>git clone git://github.com/pigmonkey/dotfiles.git\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/bash_colors ~/.bash_colors\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s ~/src/dotfiles/screenrc ~/.screenrc\n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Time</h3>\n<p>The next step is to set the server&#8217;s timezone and sync the clock with <a href="http://www.ntp.org">NTP</a>.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install ntp\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Rootkits</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason not to run both <a href="http://www.chkrootkit.org/">chkrootkit</a> and <a href="http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net">rkhunter</a> to check for rootkits and related vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4>chrkrootkit</h4>\n<p>Slicehost has <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/3/24/scanning-for-rootkits-with-chkrootkit-updated">an excellent article for setting up and using chkrootkit</a>.</p>\n<p>Later on I&#8217;ll be installing some Python development packages. One of them creates a directory called <code>/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/.path</code>, which sets off a warning in chkrootkit. Part of chkrootkit&#8217;s desgin philosophy is to not include any whitelists: if chkrootkit finds something that it doesn&#8217;t like, you&#8217;re going to hear about it. I have cron run chkrootkit nightly and I want to receive any warnings, but I don&#8217;t want to receive the same false positive every morning in my inbox.</p>\n<p>The solution is to create a file that contains chkrootkit&#8217;s warning. I call that file <code>whitelist</code> and store it in the same directory as chkrootkit. When chkrootkit is run, any output is redirected to a file. That file is compared to the whitelist using <code>diff</code> and the output <em>of that</em> &#8212; if any &#8212; is then read. At the end, the file containing chkrootkit&#8217;s output is deleted so that the working directory is ready for the next run. The effect is that I only hear warnings from chkrootkit that I <em>have not explicit whitelisted</em>. All of this can be accomplished in a single crontab entry.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre>0 3 * * * <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">cd</span> /home/demo/src/chkrootkit-0.49; ./chkrootkit -q &gt; message 2&gt;&amp;1; diff -w whitelist message; rm -f message<span class="o">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<h4>rkhunter</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t surprise you that I&#8217;m going to recommend reading Slicehost&#8217;s <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/3/24/scanning-for-rootkits-with-rkhunter-updated">article on rkhunter</a>.</p>\n<p>Unlike chkrootkit, rkhunter does allow for whitelists. On a clean Ubuntu 10.04 system, I find that I need to whitelist a few items in the config.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo vim /etc/rkhunter.conf\n\n<span class="nv">SCRIPTWHITELIST</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/usr/sbin/adduser /usr/bin/ldd /bin/which&quot;</span>\n<span class="nv">ALLOWHIDDENDIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/dev/.udev /dev/.initramfs&quot;</span>\n<span class="nv">APP_WHITELIST</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;openssl:0.9.8k gpg:1.4.10&quot;</span>\n\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --propupd\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The script that my cronjob runs is slightly different from the one demonstrated in the Slicehost article. Their script executes a few commands, groups the output together, and sends it to <code>mail</code> to email the system administrator. This results in daily emails, regardless of whether rkhunter finds any warnings or not. My script is simpler and does not result in so many messages.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>\n/usr/local/bin/rkhunter --versioncheck -q\n/usr/local/bin/rkhunter --update -q\n/usr/local/bin/rkhunter --cronjob --report-warnings-only\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The version check and update commands both have the <code>-q</code> switch, which disables any output &#8212; I don&#8217;t care to know whether rkhunter updated itself or not. The final line actually executes the scan. Notice that there&#8217;s no reference to <code>mail</code>. This script does not send any messages. The reason for that is that rkhunter itself provides the mail functionality. Inside of <code>/etc/rkhunter.conf</code> there is a <code>MAIL-ON-WARNING</code> variable. As long as the machine has an smtp server on it (which I&#8217;ll get to later in this guide), simply filling in this variable will result in any warnings being emailed to the system administrator.</p>\n<h2>Web Server</h2>\n<p>With the basics complete, it&#8217;s time to start serving something! In my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-web-server/">previous article</a> I covered serving a PHP-based Wordpress site via FastCGI and nginx. This time around the stack will be different: <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a>, <a href="http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/">uWSGI</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.</p>\n<p>A few basic packages will help flesh out the server&#8217;s Python development environment:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-setuptools python2.6-dev psmisc python-imaging locate python-dateutil libxml2-dev python-software-properties\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>uWSGI</h3>\n<p>Installing <a href="http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/">uWSGI</a> is a simple matter of compiling it and moving the resulting binary into one of your system&#8217;s bin directories.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/src/\n<span class="nv">$ </span>wget http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/uwsgi-0.9.8.tar.gz\n<span class="nv">$ </span>tar xvzf ~/uwsgi-0.9.8.tar.gz \n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>uwsgi-0.9.8/\n<span class="nv">$ </span>make -f Makefile.Py26\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo cp uwsgi /usr/local/sbin\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>nginx</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> package in Ubuntu&#8217;s official repositories is always notoriously outdated. It used to be you had to compile the server from source, but there is now an <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">Ubuntu PPA</a> for the latest stable versions. <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Install#Ubuntu_PPA">As described by the nginx wiki</a>, all that is needed is to add the PPA to your <code>sources.list</code> and <code>apt-get</code> away!</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get update \n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install nginx\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Python and Django</h3>\n<p>If you do Python development and haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>, it is well worth reading up on. It allows the user to create an isolated, virtual Python environment for each project. This helps immensely when developing (or serving) multiple projects on a single machine. Needless to say, I consider it to be a required package.</p>\n<h4>Install</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be installing virtualenv and <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper">virtualenvwrapper</a> (a set of scripts to facilitate working with virtual environments). I also prefer <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> over <code>easy_install</code> for managing Python packages.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo easy_install -U pip \n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo pip install virtualenv\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper\n</pre></div>\n\n<h4>Setup a virtual environment</h4>\n<p>Virtual environments can be stored wherever you fancy. For now, I keep them in a hidden folder in my home directory. For these examples, I&#8217;ll setup an environment called <code>myproject</code>.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir ~/.virtualenvs\n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.virtualenvs\n<span class="nv">$ </span>virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute myproject\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice the <code>--no-site-packages</code> switch. That tells <code>virtualenv</code> to create this environment without any of the Python packages already installed, creating a completely fresh, clean environment. The <code>--distribute</code> switch causes the new virtual environment to be setup with <a href="http://packages.python.org/distribute/">distribute</a>, a replacement for the old and rather broken <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>.</p>\n<p>All that&#8217;s needed to get <code>virtualenvwrapper</code> up and running is to add two lines to your <code>.bashrc</code> and re-source the file.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>vim ~/.bashrc\n\n<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">WORKON_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.virtualenvs\n<span class="nb">source</span> /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n\n<span class="nv">$ </span>. ~/.bashrc\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>We can now use commands like <code>workon</code> to ease the process of activating a certain environment.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll go ahead and install <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yolk">yolk</a> in the environment to help manage packages.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>workon myproject\n<span class="nv">$ </span>pip install yolk\n<span class="nv">$ </span>yolk -l\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The last command will cause <code>yolk</code> to list all packages installed in the environment. Try deactivating the environment and then running <code>yolk</code> again.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>deactivate\n<span class="nv">$ </span>yolk -l\nyolk: <span class="nb">command </span>not found\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>&#8216;yolk&#8217; wasn&#8217;t found, because it was only installed within the virtual environment. Neat!</p>\n<h4>Install Django</h4>\n<p>Finally, it&#8217;s time to install Django! The process is simple enough.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>workon myproject\n<span class="nv">$ </span>pip install django\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a> is likely to be needed for any Django project. I installed it in the beginning of this section, but because I used the <code>--no-site-packages</code> when creating my virtual environment, it is not available for use within the project. To fix that, I&#8217;ll just link the package in. I also previously installed <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psyopg2</a>, which Python will need to communicate with my PostgreSQL database, so I&#8217;ll link that in as well. <code>psyopg2</code> depends on <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/">mx</a>, which was also previously installed but still must be made available in the environment.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>cdsitepackages\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PIL\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PIL.pth\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/psycopg2\n<span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/mx\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t too painful!</p>\n<h4>Create a Django project</h4>\n<p>While I&#8217;m still in the virtual environment, I&#8217;ll go ahead and create a new Django project. The project will have the same name as the environment: <code>myproject</code>. For this tutorial, I&#8217;ll stick with the precedence set by the Slicehost tutorials and use <code>demo</code> as the name of both my user and group on the server.</p>\n<p>I like to keep my sites in the <code>/srv/</code> directory. I structure them so that the code that runs the site, any public files, logs, and backups are all stored in separate sub-directories.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> /srv/\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo mkdir -p myproject.com/<span class="o">{</span>code,public,logs,backup<span class="o">}</span>\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo mkdir -p myproject.com/public/<span class="o">{</span>media,static<span class="o">}</span>\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo chown -R demo:demo myproject.com\n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>myproject.com\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo chown -R :www-data logs public\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo chmod -R g+w logs public\n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>code/\n<span class="nv">$ </span>django-admin.py startproject myproject\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice that the <code>logs</code> and <code>public</code> directories were <code>chown</code>ed to the www-data group. That is the name of the user and group that nginx will run as. The web server will need permissions to write to those locations.</p>\n<h4>Save Requirements</h4>\n<p>With the environment setup and all the necessary packages installed, now is a good time to tell pip to <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/#freezing-requirements">freeze</a> all the packages and their versions. I keep this file in a <code>deploy</code> folder in my project.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy\n<span class="nv">$ </span>pip freeze &gt; /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/requirements.txt\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now, if I needed to recreate the virtual environment somewhere else, I could just tell pip to install all the packages from that file.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install -r /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/requirements.txt\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Configure uWSGI</h3>\n<p>Now that I have something to serve, I&#8217;ll configure uWSGI to serve it. The first step is to create a configuration file for the project. I call mine <code>wsgi.py</code> and store it in <code>/srv/myproject.com/code/myproject/</code>. It appends the current directory to the Python path, specifies the Django settings file for the project, and registers the WSGI handler.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>\n<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>\n\n<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">abspath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dirname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__file__</span><span class="p">)))</span>\n<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;myproject.settings&#39;</span>\n\n<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">django.core.handlers.wsgi</span>\n\n<span class="n">application</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">django</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">handlers</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wsgi</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">WSGIHandler</span><span class="p">()</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>With that done, the next step is to decide how uWSGI should be run. I&#8217;m going to use Ubuntu&#8217;s <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">upstart</a> to supervise the service. I keep the upstart script in my project&#8217;s <code>deploy/</code> directory.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>vim /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/uwsgi.conf\n\ndescription <span class="s2">&quot;uWSGI server for My Project&quot;</span>\n\nstart on runlevel <span class="o">[</span>2345<span class="o">]</span>\nstop on runlevel <span class="o">[</span>!2345<span class="o">]</span>\n\nrespawn\n<span class="nb">exec</span> /usr/local/sbin/uwsgi <span class="se">\\</span>\n--home /home/demo/.virtualenvs/myproject/ <span class="se">\\</span>\n--socket /var/run/myproject.com.sock <span class="se">\\</span>\n--chmod-socket <span class="se">\\</span>\n--pythonpath /srv/myproject.com/code/ <span class="se">\\</span>\n--module myproject.wsgi <span class="se">\\</span>\n--process 2 <span class="se">\\</span>\n--harakiri 30 <span class="se">\\</span>\n--master <span class="se">\\</span>\n--logto /srv/myproject.com/logs/uwsgi.log\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Sadly, upstart doesn&#8217;t seem to recognize links. Rather than linking the config file into <code>/etc/init/</code>, I have to copy it.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo cp /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/uwsgi.conf /etc/init/uwsgi-myproject.conf\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Configure nginx</h3>\n<p>Nginx&#8217;s configuration is pretty straight-forward. If you&#8217;ve never configured the server before, <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/nginx">Slicehost&#8217;s articles</a> can set you down the right path. My own nginx config looks something like this:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">user</span> <span class="n">www</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="n">www</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="n">worker_processes</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="n">pid</span> <span class="sr">/var/</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pid</span><span class="p">;</span>\n\n<span class="n">events</span> <span class="p">{</span>\n        <span class="n">worker_connections</span> <span class="mi">768</span><span class="p">;</span>\n        <span class="k">use</span> <span class="n">epoll</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n\n<span class="n">http</span> <span class="p">{</span>\n\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n    <span class="c1"># Basic Settings</span>\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n\n    <span class="n">sendfile</span> <span class="n">on</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">tcp_nopush</span> <span class="n">on</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">tcp_nodelay</span> <span class="n">on</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">keepalive_timeout</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">types_hash_max_size</span> <span class="mi">2048</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="c1"># server_tokens off;</span>\n\n    <span class="c1"># server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;</span>\n    <span class="c1"># server_name_in_redirect off;</span>\n\n    <span class="n">include</span> <span class="sr">/etc/</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">mime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">types</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">default_type</span> <span class="n">application</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">octet</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">stream</span><span class="p">;</span>\n\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n    <span class="c1"># Logging Settings</span>\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n\n    <span class="n">access_log</span> <span class="sr">/var/</span><span class="nb">log</span><span class="sr">/nginx/</span><span class="n">access</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">log</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">error_log</span> <span class="sr">/var/</span><span class="nb">log</span><span class="sr">/nginx/</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nb">log</span><span class="p">;</span>\n\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n    <span class="c1"># Gzip Settings</span>\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n\n    <span class="n">gzip</span> <span class="n">on</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">gzip_disable</span> <span class="s">&quot;msie6&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">gzip_types</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="sr">/plain text/css</span> <span class="n">application</span><span class="sr">/json application/x</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">javascript</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="sr">/xml application/xm</span><span class="n">l</span> <span class="n">application</span><span class="sr">/xml+rss text/</span><span class="n">javascript</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">gzip_proxied</span> <span class="n">any</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">gzip_comp_level</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>\n\n    <span class="c1"># gzip_vary on;</span>\n    <span class="c1"># gzip_buffers 16 8k;</span>\n    <span class="c1"># gzip_http_version 1.1;</span>\n\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n    <span class="c1"># Virtual Host Configs</span>\n    <span class="c1">##</span>\n\n    <span class="n">include</span> <span class="sr">/etc/</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="sr">/conf.d/</span><span class="o">*.</span><span class="n">conf</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">include</span> <span class="sr">/etc/</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="sr">/sites-enabled/</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>I keep the virtual host config for my project inside the project&#8217;s <code>code/deploy/</code> directory.

I like to take advantage of it with a memory-based backend: namely, <a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a>. It&#8217;s fast, efficient, and easy to setup.</p>\n<p>All that&#8217;s needed is to install memcached on the server, followed by the Python API <a href="http://www.tummy.com/Community/software/python-memcached/">python-memcached</a>. </p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install memcached\n<span class="nv">$ </span>workon myproject\n<span class="nv">$ </span>pip install python-memcached\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The default configuration file in Ubuntu lives at <code>/etc/memcached.conf</code>. I usually stick with the defaults, but sometimes end up changing the port that memchached runs on or the amount of memory it is allowed to use.</p>\n<h3>logrotate</h3>\n<p>With the web server more-or-less complete, I like to setup logrotate to manage the logs in my project&#8217;s directory. Once again, Slicehost has <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/6/30/understanding-logrotate-on-ubuntu-part-1">an excellent introduction to logrotate</a> and <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/6/30/understanding-logrotate-on-ubuntu-part-2">an example config for virtual hosts</a>.</p>\n<p>I maintain a configuration file for each of the domains being served by the machine. The file for a domain lives in &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; the associated project&#8217;s <code>deploy/</code> folder. Each contains two entries: one for the nginx virtual host and one for the uWSGI instance. The reason for this is that each config block needs a <code>postrotate</code> section to restart the associated server after the logs have been rotated. I don&#8217;t want nginx to be restarted everytime a uWSGI log is rotated, and I don&#8217;t want uWSGI restarted everytime an nginx log is rotated.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>vim /srv/myproject.com/code/deploy/logrotate\n\n/srv/myproject.com/logs/access.log /srv/myproject.com/logs/error.log <span class="o">{</span>\n    rotate 14\n    daily\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    sharedscripts\n    postrotate\n        <span class="o">[</span> ! -f /var/run/nginx.pid <span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">kill</span> -USR1 <span class="sb">`</span>cat /var/run/nginx.pid<span class="sb">`</span>\n    endscript\n<span class="o">}</span>\n\n/srv/myproject.com/logs/uwsgi.log <span class="o">{</span>\n    rotate 14\n    daily\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    postrotate\n       restart --quiet uwsgi-myproject\n    endscript\n<span class="o">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This file is linked in to the <code>/etc/logrotate.d/</code> directory.

I use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.</p>\n<h3>Install</h3>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install postgresql\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Configure</h3>\n<p>PostgreSQL has some unique terminology and ways of doing things. When I first set it up for the first time, having coming from a MySQL background, not everything was completely straightforward. As usual, <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/postgresql">Slicehost has a number of articles</a> that will provide a foundation.</p>\n<p>In the <code>/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf</code> file, I uncomment the following two lines:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">track_counts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">on</span>\n<span class="n">autovacuum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">on</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Then restart the database server.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>After that I&#8217;ll change the password for the postgres user and the postgres database role.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo passwd postgres\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo -u postgres psql\n<span class="se">\\p</span>assword postgres\n<span class="se">\\q</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>To allow local socket connections to the database using passwords, I open up <code>/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf</code> and find the following line:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">local</span>   <span class="n">all</span>         <span class="n">all</span>                               <span class="n">ident</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Which I then change to:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">local</span>   <span class="n">all</span>         <span class="n">all</span>                               <span class="n">md5</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>After which another restart is in order.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart\n</pre></div>\n\n<h3>Create a database</h3>\n<p>The next step is to create a user (or role, in PostgreSQL&#8217;s parlance) and database for the project. I use the same name for both.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo -u postgres createuser -PE myproject\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo -u postgres createdb -O myproject myproject\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>After that, I should be able to connect.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>psql -U myproject\n</pre></div>\n\n<h4>Import the Database</h4>\n<p>If I&#8217;m restoring a previous database from a backup, now would be the time to import the backup.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>psql -U myproject &lt; myproject.postgresql\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And now Django should be able to connect!</p>\n<p>The basic server is setup and secure. Django, uWSGI, nginx and PostgreSQL are all running and getting along swimmingly. At this point, many people would be done, but I also like to have a minimal mail server.</p>\n<h2>Mail Server</h2>\n<p>Most of my domains use <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/">Google Apps</a>, so I don&#8217;t need a full-blown mail server. I do want programs and scripts to be able to send mail, and I prefer not to do so through an external SMTP server &#8212; I&#8217;d rather just deal with having sendmail running on my own box. And I do have a few domains that do not use Google Apps. They have one or two aliases associated with them, so the server needs to receive messages for those domains and forward them off to an external address. If any of this sounds vaguely familiar, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the same thing I detailed <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-mail/">last time</a>. My setup now is the same as then, so I won&#8217;t repeat any of it here.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed explanation of running <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>, you can <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/email">read the Slicehost articles</a>.</p>\n<h2>A Note on Git</h2>\n<p>I use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to keep track of the code for all my projects. (If you&#8217;re new to Git, you ought to skim the <a href="http://gitref.org/">Git Reference</a> or <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html">Everyday GIT With 20 Commands Or So</a>). To manage websites, I create a repository of the directory with the code that runs the site (in this case, <code>/srv/myproject.com/code/</code>) and another empty, bare repository to work as a hub. With a <code>post-update</code> and <code>post-commit</code>, the end result is an excellent web workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A copy of the hub can be checked out on a local machine for development. Whenever a change is committed, a simple <code>git push</code> will push the code to the web server and automatically make it live.</li>\n<li>Changes can be made on the server in the actual live website directory.

    vellum_post_16.body = u'Avagdu and I pulled into the trailhead around 7 PM. After getting our gear together, we decided to take advantage of the long summer evening to log a few miles. The trail into the [Red Buttes Wilderness](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Red_Buttes_Wilderness) climbs steadily through pine woods. It\'s dry and dusty with the lack of rain. But that\'s to be expected. We\'re back in California, after all.\r\n\r\nOccasional glimpses of large slides and the valley below can be had through the trees. Soon enough, the sun sets behind the hills. I remove the headlamp from my pack and throw it around my neck. Avagdu stops a minute later to do the same. There\'s another hour or so of good hiking to be got yet.\r\n\r\nOur destination this night is Echo Lake. I don\'t think it\'s too much further down the trail. After I wet my feet in a stream crossing, I figure we must be close, but the sun is down, the moon not yet risen, and I\'m worried I\'ll miss the spur trail that goes off to the lake. Shortly after the crossing we\'re surprised by a small wilderness camp: a shelter made of 4 upright posts and a few pine boughs for a roof, a table, a bit of firewood, and what is either an attempt at a chair or a [Nessmuk](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/George_W._Sears)-style fire. I can\'t tell which. It\'s an impressive setup. "Someone Ray Mears-ed it up," Avagdu says. The only thing we can\'t figure out is why the shelter is lashed together with duct tape rather than cordage. Or why the bundle of firewood is wrapped in duct tape.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892374349/" title="Wilderness Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5892374349_4962b52a3a_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Wilderness Camp"></a>\r\n\r\nIt\'s a bit after 10 PM now. We decide to take advantage of our luck and spend the night here. The shelter doesn\'t look waterproof, but there\'s no other flat ground around. It doesn\'t feel like rain tonight anyway. There\'s enough room for us both to throw our bivvies down underneath.\r\n\r\nI had eaten before reaching the trail. The meal is still sitting in my belly. Forgoing dinner, I go off to hang my food. Avagdu decides to cook a small meal for himself -- out of hunger, or just so that he\'ll have a few less ounces to carry tomorrow. While we\'re sitting around the fire pit, I spot a small mouse scurrying around the shelter. He seems disappointed that new tenants have moved in. Particularly because we had moved the old sock (his bed, I think) from the ground of the shelter to the table. After sniffing around for a while he scurries off.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892377423/" title="Wilderness Camp Table by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6032/5892377423_408e4502d1_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Wilderness Camp Table"></a>\r\n\r\nWe\'re off early in the morning, with expectations of a short climb before arriving at the lake for breakfast.\r\n\r\nThings don\'t go as planned.\r\n\r\nThe grade steepens, as expected, but the trail keeps going on. Eventually we break out of the trees into a muddy meadow. Snow patches begin to appear. Somewhere in the meadow I loose the trail. By 10 AM we both feel that we should have reached Echo Lake. The mileage posted at the trailhead was only 4 miles, which we\'ve certainly accomplished by now. I\'m getting hungry, so I decide to stop in a patch of trees for a bowl of oatmeal. We both eat. After cleaning my pot I get out the map. It\'s a large, ungainly thing. I plot our position and get a bearing to the lake. Not too far off, but I still don\'t trust the mileage. It\'s definitely further than 4 miles from the trailhead.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892955308/" title="Red Buttes Wilderness by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5075/5892955308_e70cb618b8_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Red Buttes Wilderness"></a>\r\n\r\nWe climb up higher. The snow is constant now. We end up on a small knob above the lake. Echo Lake is surrounded by snow and looks to be still partially frozen over. Neither of us feel like venturing down for a visit. Our route now takes us up out of the basin onto the Siskiyou Crest. If we went down to the lake we\'d just have to climb back up again. So we decide to forgo the lake and instead head higher, aiming for the saddle between Red Butte and Cook and Green Butte.\r\n\r\nThe slope we\'re climbing is facing north. I hope that once we get over to the other side the snow will be gone. Or at least less. Before leaving for the trip I hadn\'t been able to find any recent reports or conditions for the area. I figured we wouldn\'t be getting very high and, hey, it\'s California (the whole state is a desert, right?), so we didn\'t plan for much snow.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892393801/" title="Climbing to the Saddle by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5302/5892393801_8fc4a33165_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Climbing to the Saddle"></a>\r\n\r\nI\'m wearing my Merrell Trail Gloves, which aren\'t exactly ideal for kicking steps. But going uphill isn\'t too much trouble. We reach a bare scree field, climb it, and gain the saddle. I\'m pleased to see that both the top of the ridge and the south slope are covered not by snow, but by Manzanita.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892969386/" title="Atop the Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5151/5892969386_d81ed9e77d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Atop the Ridge"></a>\r\n\r\nJust on the other side of the ridge is our goal: the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail). We\'ll be on the PCT for the next few miles, which ought to help us make up for time lost in the snow. The PCT is the superhighway of the mountains -- wide, tame, and well groomed compared to most wilderness trails.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892410359/" title="Pacific Crest Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5191/5892410359_e5151a4cb0_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Pacific Crest Trail"></a>\r\n\r\nOur route takes us west along the ridge, toward Red Butte. Only a few yards down the trail we come upon a group of three camped on the ridge. They had planned the same route as we, but also did not expect the trail to Echo Lake to be so long nor the snow to be so prevalent. It had upset their schedule. They no longer had time to complete the loop. Instead, they decided to spend some time enjoying the view from the ridgetop before descending and heading out.\r\n\r\nThe trail is wide and dry. It goes on for a bit before intersecting an old logging road. Just west of the junction both road and trail continue into a snow-filled basin. So much for dry feet! There\'s a good stream of snow melt flowing here which we use to fill up our reservoirs, not sure where the next good source will be.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892417019/" title="Water Break by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5892417019_02c9258348_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Water Break"></a>\r\n\r\nFrom there, the trail climbs over a ridge and down into another basin, which holds Lily Pad Lake. The road parallels the trail and ends in the same lake basin. I choose to follow the road, which is easier to spot under snow. The basin provides views of the other side of Red Butte, the namesake of this Wilderness.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892423663/" title="Red Butte Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5076/5892423663_c1e0bb6192_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Red Butte Basin"></a>\r\n\r\nOnce across, both road and trail take a steep route up and out of the basin. I decide to take a route slightly longer but easier given the snow. Once gaining the other side, we\'re once again in mostly dry territory with only occasional patches of snow. I find the PCT and follow that for a bit before loosing it in another snow field. On the other side, I find the road. Good enough.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892427833/" title="End of the Road by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5892427833_cd920115c2_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="End of the Road"></a>\r\n\r\nThe road ends at a fence made of stacked rocks. From there we can look down into this new basin and see the PCT. Lily Pad Lake sits below it. Both hold more snow. The ridge on the west side of the basin has more snow and looks steeper than any field we\'ve yet encountered. We must climb that, but not yet. It\'s early afternoon and my stomach calls for lunch.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892431747/" title="Rock Fence and Gate by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5892431747_0b9ecffd1d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Rock Fence and Gate"></a>\r\n\r\nIt\'s windy up on the ridge. There\'s a small notch in the rock fence where I setup my stove, keeping it out of the wind. A pot full of noodles, a few mouthfuls of granola with dark chocolate chips, and I\'m feeling copacetic in the sun. But we\'re not getting any closer to the other side of the basin and Avagdu has finished his crackers and MRE peanut butter. It\'s time to move on.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892434373/" title="Preparing for Lily Pad Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5078/5892434373_e951acf0c4_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Preparing for Lily Pad Lake"></a>\r\n\r\nClimbing down from the end of the road we regain the the PCT. It is soon obscured by snow. The slope is indeed steep here -- steep enough that I don\'t feel safe crossing it without an ice axe or traction devices. But there\'s a bare spot above. I make for that, where we can cross above the snow field and then come back down on the other side. I\'m having flashbacks of [last year in the Glacier Peak Wilderness](http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/20/a-few-days-in-the-glacier-peak-wilderness/).\r\n\r\nWe make it to the top, and across, but before heading back down to where we need to be there\'s a finger of the snow field to descend. Avagdu goes first, sitting down on the snow and attempting a controlled descent that ends up being a glissade to the other side. I do the same.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892440083/" title="A Tricky Descent by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5892440083_d93e31d0c8_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="A Tricky Descent"></a>\r\n\r\nIt\'s not much further till we reach a similar obstacle. But this time we can\'t go up and around the snow. The only choice is to go straight across. I lead this one, slowly kicking steps across the field. It\'s easier to cross on a diagonal line, heading slightly uphill. Eventually I end up above where I need to be, with Avagdu behind me. Below, the snow continues for 30 feet before reaching the trail, which at that point is bare. It\'s a steep glissade without an ice axe to control the descent. The best option looks to be to sit and attempt to crab walk down, kicking in my heels to make steps as I descend. This works till about halfway, where a step fails and I slip, sliding down the rest of the way. It\'s close -- I almost miss the bare spot and end up in a tree well further down the mountain -- but I\'m able to slide enough to the right that I make it, with no problem other than cold hands from digging into the snow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Avagdu is above, watching the performance with some amount of trepidation. He sits down for his turn and I attempt to guide him in, instructing him to kick steps with his heels and aim for the log on the trail. The beginning is good. Then he slips and starts the glissade. He\'s further to the left than I was, but he\'s reaching for the handholds on the exposed trail and it looks like he\'ll make it without trouble, until his reach turns into a somersault. Luckily the somersault takes him in the right direction and he crashes into a branch of the log or a bit of rock. I can\'t see which. Later, he says that whatever hit him did so on his heavily padded hip-belt, which probably saved him some discomfort and bruising on the hip.\r\n\r\nAfter a well deserved breather and a bit of water, we continue. It\'s not too much longer before, predictably, the trail once again crosses into snow and enters a steep slope. This time it looks like we can go up and around along a tricky scree field, but a group of large boulders prevents me from seeing what is held in store for us on the other side.\r\n\r\nWe go for it, carefully making our way across the scree along the edge of the snow. It\'s the most difficult part yet. On the other side, I climb up the group of boulders to getter a better view of the route above. It\'s not a good sight. We\'re almost at the top of the ridge, but directly across from us is another steep, snow covered slope. There\'s no way around it, above or below, and I don\'t want to attempt another crossing so steep without more tools. Directly above us is steep as well. We might be able to make it, climbing with both hands and feet, but there look to be a few cornices up there at the top. That makes me uncomfortable. Avagdu has come around by this time and points out a possible route, saying that there\'s a few trees along there to break our fall. I start laughing. That\'s exactly what I look for when I\'m scouting out a route, but hearing it voiced out loud is somehow humorous. "Yeah, don\'t worry, there\'s some ground down there to break our fall!"\r\n\r\nAnother look around. It doesn\'t look good. I still can\'t see over the top of this ridge, so even if we make it up I\'m not sure what waits for us further on. More of the same, likely, which will upset our schedule.\r\n\r\nI suggest we turn around. Avagdu agrees. If we\'re careful, we can take Avagdu\'s suggested route a little further along, which will put is in intermittent trees. We can glissade from tree to tree, hopefully avoiding any big wells, and make it down to the bottom of the basin. From there, it\'s a simple matter of crossing the basin (while avoiding a fall into the lake, which is still partially obscured by snow). The other side of the basin is clear of snow, so we can switchback our way up till we hit the trail or road, and then backtrack to the saddle between the two buttes where we first climbed up out of the basin and Echo Lake.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892443151/" title="Lily Pad Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5892443151_70ff7705df_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Lily Pad Lake"></a>\r\n\r\nWe reached the spot where we first joined the PCT. The camp belonging to the group of 3 is gone. They must have packed out ahead of us.\r\n\r\nI scout out the ridge a bit, checking to see if there\'s a better way down the north side than the route we took up. There doesn\'t seem to be anything. Looking down from the spot where we finally gained the ridge on the way up, our path looks steeper than before. Funny how that works.\r\n\r\nAvagdu and I both relax for a bit, enjoying the view and watching a few clouds roll in. The slope isn\'t getting any less steep. After chucking a few rocks down to see where they land, we decide to go for it.\r\n\r\nWe descend the bare scree field and are back in the snow. Luckily, we can glissade down this time rather than having to climb up. It\'s quick, and fun.\r\n\r\nJust below where we now know Echo Lake to be we come upon the remains of an old fire ring. There are flat spots around that will make decent spots for us to pitch our tarps, but with the lake on one side and the muddy meadow on the other it looks like it will become too buggy for my tastes. We opt to continue down further, crossing the meadow and descending back into the woods.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5893019734/" title="Descending into the Trees by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6048/5893019734_c2489d5f66_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Descending into the Trees"></a>\r\n\r\nAt 7 PM we reach a spot with wide flat areas at the base of a cliff. There\'s a small trickle of water in the back and the trees are sparse enough to let the sunlight in and allow some views of the sky. This will do for camp.\r\n\r\nAn abundance of dead wood lies on the floor. The novelty of actually picking dry firewood off the ground rather than having to break it out of trees encourages me to start collecting the makings of a fire. While Avagdu is pitching his tarp I take a spade-shaped rock to dig a small pit. Then I build a basic lay. Soon the flames are jumping.\r\n\r\nThe night brings heavy rain. The noise on the tarp is enough to wake me up a few times during the night. In the morning I wake but don\'t rise for a couple hours, hoping that the rain will soon die down. When it turns to a light sprinkle, I venture out. Our camp has certainly become wet. Avagdu is up and about. He didn\'t pack much in the way of insulating layers, so he\'s chilly and wants a fire. All of the wood is now sodden. Even that up in the trees is wet, none of the branches being thick enough to protect those below them. It takes some doing, but eventually, with a bit of splitting, feathering, and a few other tricks, we rekindle the fire.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892454789/" title="A Soggy Fire by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6016/5892454789_0d75391a0b_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="A Soggy Fire"></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the rain picks up again. Neither of us want to sit around outside getting wet, so we retreat to the tarps. The rain puts out our unattended fire.\r\n\r\nWe have no firm plans for this day. By late morning it appears that the rain won\'t give up. We decide that rather than staying in the wet woods all day, it will be better for us to head out and continue on our road trip back up to Washington. A few hours on the road today will make us more likely to accomplish our goal of being in Portland for a meeting on the morrow.\r\n\r\nAs we break camp the rain continues. We descend lower into the valley. The rain becomes heavier. The sky seems like a torrent by the time we reach the bottom, and both of us are wet. The trailhead is reached shortly after, and there: shelter and some dry clothes.\r\n\r\nI leave the mountains, sure in the knowledge that I will return. Perhaps to a different range, but to mountains none the less.\r\n\r\n> Give him a far reach of eye, the grasses rippling, the small streams talking, buttes swimming clear a hundred miles away.

    vellum_post_16.body_rendered = u'<p>Avagdu and I pulled into the trailhead around 7 PM. After getting our gear together, we decided to take advantage of the long summer evening to log a few miles. The trail into the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Red_Buttes_Wilderness">Red Buttes Wilderness</a> climbs steadily through pine woods. It&#8217;s dry and dusty with the lack of rain. But that&#8217;s to be expected. We&#8217;re back in California, after all.</p>\n<p>Occasional glimpses of large slides and the valley below can be had through the trees. Soon enough, the sun sets behind the hills. I remove the headlamp from my pack and throw it around my neck. Avagdu stops a minute later to do the same. There&#8217;s another hour or so of good hiking to be got yet.</p>\n<p>Our destination this night is Echo Lake. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much further down the trail. After I wet my feet in a stream crossing, I figure we must be close, but the sun is down, the moon not yet risen, and I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;ll miss the spur trail that goes off to the lake. Shortly after the crossing we&#8217;re surprised by a small wilderness camp: a shelter made of 4 upright posts and a few pine boughs for a roof, a table, a bit of firewood, and what is either an attempt at a chair or a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/George_W._Sears">Nessmuk</a>-style fire. I can&#8217;t tell which. It&#8217;s an impressive setup. &#8220;Someone Ray Mears-ed it up,&#8221; Avagdu says. The only thing we can&#8217;t figure out is why the shelter is lashed together with duct tape rather than cordage. Or why the bundle of firewood is wrapped in duct tape.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892374349/" title="Wilderness Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5892374349_4962b52a3a_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Wilderness Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit after 10 PM now. We decide to take advantage of our luck and spend the night here. The shelter doesn&#8217;t look waterproof, but there&#8217;s no other flat ground around. It doesn&#8217;t feel like rain tonight anyway. There&#8217;s enough room for us both to throw our bivvies down underneath.</p>\n<p>I had eaten before reaching the trail. The meal is still sitting in my belly. Forgoing dinner, I go off to hang my food. Avagdu decides to cook a small meal for himself &#8212; out of hunger, or just so that he&#8217;ll have a few less ounces to carry tomorrow. While we&#8217;re sitting around the fire pit, I spot a small mouse scurrying around the shelter. He seems disappointed that new tenants have moved in. Particularly because we had moved the old sock (his bed, I think) from the ground of the shelter to the table. After sniffing around for a while he scurries off.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892377423/" title="Wilderness Camp Table by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6032/5892377423_408e4502d1_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Wilderness Camp Table" /></a></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re off early in the morning, with expectations of a short climb before arriving at the lake for breakfast.</p>\n<p>Things don&#8217;t go as planned.</p>\n<p>The grade steepens, as expected, but the trail keeps going on. Eventually we break out of the trees into a muddy meadow. Snow patches begin to appear. Somewhere in the meadow I loose the trail. By 10 AM we both feel that we should have reached Echo Lake. The mileage posted at the trailhead was only 4 miles, which we&#8217;ve certainly accomplished by now. I&#8217;m getting hungry, so I decide to stop in a patch of trees for a bowl of oatmeal. We both eat. After cleaning my pot I get out the map. It&#8217;s a large, ungainly thing. I plot our position and get a bearing to the lake. Not too far off, but I still don&#8217;t trust the mileage. It&#8217;s definitely further than 4 miles from the trailhead.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892955308/" title="Red Buttes Wilderness by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5075/5892955308_e70cb618b8_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Red Buttes Wilderness" /></a></p>\n<p>We climb up higher. The snow is constant now. We end up on a small knob above the lake. Echo Lake is surrounded by snow and looks to be still partially frozen over. Neither of us feel like venturing down for a visit. Our route now takes us up out of the basin onto the Siskiyou Crest. If we went down to the lake we&#8217;d just have to climb back up again. So we decide to forgo the lake and instead head higher, aiming for the saddle between Red Butte and Cook and Green Butte.</p>\n<p>The slope we&#8217;re climbing is facing north. I hope that once we get over to the other side the snow will be gone. Or at least less. Before leaving for the trip I hadn&#8217;t been able to find any recent reports or conditions for the area. I figured we wouldn&#8217;t be getting very high and, hey, it&#8217;s California (the whole state is a desert, right?), so we didn&#8217;t plan for much snow.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892393801/" title="Climbing to the Saddle by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5302/5892393801_8fc4a33165_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Climbing to the Saddle" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m wearing my Merrell Trail Gloves, which aren&#8217;t exactly ideal for kicking steps. But going uphill isn&#8217;t too much trouble. We reach a bare scree field, climb it, and gain the saddle. I&#8217;m pleased to see that both the top of the ridge and the south slope are covered not by snow, but by Manzanita.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892969386/" title="Atop the Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5151/5892969386_d81ed9e77d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Atop the Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>Just on the other side of the ridge is our goal: the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. We&#8217;ll be on the PCT for the next few miles, which ought to help us make up for time lost in the snow. The PCT is the superhighway of the mountains &#8212; wide, tame, and well groomed compared to most wilderness trails.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892410359/" title="Pacific Crest Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5191/5892410359_e5151a4cb0_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Pacific Crest Trail" /></a></p>\n<p>Our route takes us west along the ridge, toward Red Butte. Only a few yards down the trail we come upon a group of three camped on the ridge. They had planned the same route as we, but also did not expect the trail to Echo Lake to be so long nor the snow to be so prevalent. It had upset their schedule. They no longer had time to complete the loop. Instead, they decided to spend some time enjoying the view from the ridgetop before descending and heading out.</p>\n<p>The trail is wide and dry. It goes on for a bit before intersecting an old logging road. Just west of the junction both road and trail continue into a snow-filled basin. So much for dry feet! There&#8217;s a good stream of snow melt flowing here which we use to fill up our reservoirs, not sure where the next good source will be.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892417019/" title="Water Break by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5892417019_02c9258348_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Water Break" /></a></p>\n<p>From there, the trail climbs over a ridge and down into another basin, which holds Lily Pad Lake. The road parallels the trail and ends in the same lake basin. I choose to follow the road, which is easier to spot under snow. The basin provides views of the other side of Red Butte, the namesake of this Wilderness.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892423663/" title="Red Butte Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5076/5892423663_c1e0bb6192_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Red Butte Basin" /></a></p>\n<p>Once across, both road and trail take a steep route up and out of the basin. I decide to take a route slightly longer but easier given the snow. Once gaining the other side, we&#8217;re once again in mostly dry territory with only occasional patches of snow. I find the PCT and follow that for a bit before loosing it in another snow field. On the other side, I find the road. Good enough.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892427833/" title="End of the Road by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6018/5892427833_cd920115c2_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="End of the Road" /></a></p>\n<p>The road ends at a fence made of stacked rocks. From there we can look down into this new basin and see the PCT. Lily Pad Lake sits below it. Both hold more snow. The ridge on the west side of the basin has more snow and looks steeper than any field we&#8217;ve yet encountered. We must climb that, but not yet. It&#8217;s early afternoon and my stomach calls for lunch.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892431747/" title="Rock Fence and Gate by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5892431747_0b9ecffd1d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Rock Fence and Gate" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s windy up on the ridge. There&#8217;s a small notch in the rock fence where I setup my stove, keeping it out of the wind. A pot full of noodles, a few mouthfuls of granola with dark chocolate chips, and I&#8217;m feeling copacetic in the sun. But we&#8217;re not getting any closer to the other side of the basin and Avagdu has finished his crackers and MRE peanut butter. It&#8217;s time to move on.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892434373/" title="Preparing for Lily Pad Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5078/5892434373_e951acf0c4_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Preparing for Lily Pad Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>Climbing down from the end of the road we regain the the PCT. It is soon obscured by snow. The slope is indeed steep here &#8212; steep enough that I don&#8217;t feel safe crossing it without an ice axe or traction devices. But there&#8217;s a bare spot above. I make for that, where we can cross above the snow field and then come back down on the other side. I&#8217;m having flashbacks of <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/20/a-few-days-in-the-glacier-peak-wilderness/">last year in the Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>.</p>\n<p>We make it to the top, and across, but before heading back down to where we need to be there&#8217;s a finger of the snow field to descend. Avagdu goes first, sitting down on the snow and attempting a controlled descent that ends up being a glissade to the other side. I do the same.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892440083/" title="A Tricky Descent by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/5892440083_d93e31d0c8_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="A Tricky Descent" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not much further till we reach a similar obstacle. But this time we can&#8217;t go up and around the snow. The only choice is to go straight across. I lead this one, slowly kicking steps across the field. It&#8217;s easier to cross on a diagonal line, heading slightly uphill. Eventually I end up above where I need to be, with Avagdu behind me. Below, the snow continues for 30 feet before reaching the trail, which at that point is bare. It&#8217;s a steep glissade without an ice axe to control the descent. The best option looks to be to sit and attempt to crab walk down, kicking in my heels to make steps as I descend. This works till about halfway, where a step fails and I slip, sliding down the rest of the way. It&#8217;s close &#8212; I almost miss the bare spot and end up in a tree well further down the mountain &#8212; but I&#8217;m able to slide enough to the right that I make it, with no problem other than cold hands from digging into the snow.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Avagdu is above, watching the performance with some amount of trepidation. He sits down for his turn and I attempt to guide him in, instructing him to kick steps with his heels and aim for the log on the trail. The beginning is good. Then he slips and starts the glissade. He&#8217;s further to the left than I was, but he&#8217;s reaching for the handholds on the exposed trail and it looks like he&#8217;ll make it without trouble, until his reach turns into a somersault. Luckily the somersault takes him in the right direction and he crashes into a branch of the log or a bit of rock. I can&#8217;t see which. Later, he says that whatever hit him did so on his heavily padded hip-belt, which probably saved him some discomfort and bruising on the hip.</p>\n<p>After a well deserved breather and a bit of water, we continue. It&#8217;s not too much longer before, predictably, the trail once again crosses into snow and enters a steep slope. This time it looks like we can go up and around along a tricky scree field, but a group of large boulders prevents me from seeing what is held in store for us on the other side.</p>\n<p>We go for it, carefully making our way across the scree along the edge of the snow. It&#8217;s the most difficult part yet. On the other side, I climb up the group of boulders to getter a better view of the route above. It&#8217;s not a good sight. We&#8217;re almost at the top of the ridge, but directly across from us is another steep, snow covered slope. There&#8217;s no way around it, above or below, and I don&#8217;t want to attempt another crossing so steep without more tools. Directly above us is steep as well. We might be able to make it, climbing with both hands and feet, but there look to be a few cornices up there at the top. That makes me uncomfortable. Avagdu has come around by this time and points out a possible route, saying that there&#8217;s a few trees along there to break our fall. I start laughing. That&#8217;s exactly what I look for when I&#8217;m scouting out a route, but hearing it voiced out loud is somehow humorous. &#8220;Yeah, don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s some ground down there to break our fall!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another look around. It doesn&#8217;t look good. I still can&#8217;t see over the top of this ridge, so even if we make it up I&#8217;m not sure what waits for us further on. More of the same, likely, which will upset our schedule.</p>\n<p>I suggest we turn around. Avagdu agrees. If we&#8217;re careful, we can take Avagdu&#8217;s suggested route a little further along, which will put is in intermittent trees. We can glissade from tree to tree, hopefully avoiding any big wells, and make it down to the bottom of the basin. From there, it&#8217;s a simple matter of crossing the basin (while avoiding a fall into the lake, which is still partially obscured by snow). The other side of the basin is clear of snow, so we can switchback our way up till we hit the trail or road, and then backtrack to the saddle between the two buttes where we first climbed up out of the basin and Echo Lake.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5892443151/" title="Lily Pad Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5892443151_70ff7705df_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Lily Pad Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>We reached the spot where we first joined the PCT. The camp belonging to the group of 3 is gone. They must have packed out ahead of us.</p>\n<p>I scout out the ridge a bit, checking to see if there&#8217;s a better way down the north side than the route we took up. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything. Looking down from the spot where we finally gained the ridge on the way up, our path looks steeper than before.

    vellum_post_16.tease_rendered = u'<p>Avagdu and I pulled into the trailhead around 7 PM. After getting our gear together, we decided to take advantage of the long summer evening to log a few miles. The trail into the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Red_Buttes_Wilderness">Red Buttes Wilderness</a> climbs steadily through pine woods. It&#8217;s dry and dusty with the lack of rain. But that&#8217;s to be expected. We&#8217;re back in California, after all.</p>\n<p>Occasional glimpses of large slides and the valley below can be had through the trees. Soon enough, the sun sets behind the hills. I remove the headlamp from my pack and throw it around my neck. Avagdu stops a minute later to do the same. There&#8217;s another hour or so of good hiking to be got yet.</p>\n<p>Our destination this night is Echo Lake. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much further down the trail. After I wet my feet in a stream crossing, I figure we must be close, but the sun is down, the moon not yet risen, and I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;ll miss the spur trail that goes off to the lake. Shortly after the crossing we&#8217;re surprised by a small wilderness camp: a shelter made of 4 upright posts and a few pine boughs for a roof, a table, a bit of firewood, and what is either an attempt at a chair or a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/George_W._Sears">Nessmuk</a>-style fire. I can&#8217;t tell which. It&#8217;s an impressive setup. &#8220;Someone Ray Mears-ed it up,&#8221; Avagdu says.

    vellum_post_19.body = u"You may not notice much, but this blog has been completely rewritten.\r\n\r\nI started developing in [Django](http://djangoproject.com) last winter and quickly became smitten with both the Django framework and the [Python](http://python.org). Most of the coding I've done this year has been in Python. Naturally, I had thoughts of moving this website from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) over to a Django-based blog.\r\n\r\nFor a while I did nothing about it. Then I had another project come up that required some basic blog functionality be added to a Django-based site. A blog is -- or, at least, can be -- a fairly simple affair, but before writing my own I decided to look around and see what else was out there. There's a number of Django-based blogs floating around ([Kevin Fricovsky has a list](http://blog.montylounge.com/2010/02/10/eleven-django-blog-engines-you-should-know/)), but few of them jumped out at me. Most were not actively developed and depended on too many stale packages for my taste, or they just had a feature set that I didn't like.\r\n\r\nOut of all of them, two presented themselves as possibilities: [Mingus](https://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus) (written by the previously mentioned Kevin) and Nathan Borror's [django-basic-apps](https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps). Mingus tries to be a full-featured blogging application and was much too complex for the simple project I was then working on. But the blog application in django-basic-apps (a fork of which provides Mingus with its core blog functionality) looked like it would fit the bill. As the name implies, it is meant to be a very basic blog. I dived in to the code I discovered that, with a few modifications, it would do what I needed.\r\n\r\nSo I finished that project. But now having messed with blogging in Django I was more motivated to get started on rewriting my own site. I took another look at Mingus. Although it was too complex for the previous project, the features it provides are very similar to the features I wanted for this website. I looked at and thought about Mingus for a time, repeatedly turning it down and then coming back to it. The question centered around the project's staleness more than anything else. Currently, Mingus is built for Django 1.1. That's an old version. As of this writing, the current version is 1.3. Many improvements have been made in Django since 1.1 and I was not too keen to forgo them and run an old piece of code. Mingus is under active development, and will be updated for Django 1.3, but it's a hobby-project, so the work is understandably slow.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I decided that the best thing to do was go my own route, but take some pointers and inspiration from Mingus. I would make my own fork of django-basic-apps, using that blog as the basis, and build a system on top of that. I created [my fork](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-vellum) last month and have been steadily plodding away on it in my free time. Over the course of the development I created [a few](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wmd) [simple](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-badgr) [applications](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-twat) to complement the core blog, and [contributed code](https://github.com/bartTC/django-markup/commit/13654d7159a7c8b82f1fc3e5bd222441448b3f47) to another project.\r\n\r\nIt's not quite done -- there's still a few things I want to improve -- but it's good enough to launch. (If you notice any kinks, let me know.) I'm quite pleased with it.\r\n\r\nThis is a notable occasion. I've been using Wordpress since before it was Wordpress, but it is time to move on. (Wordpress is a fork of an old piece of code called [b2/cafelog](http://cafelog.com/). My database tables have been rocking the `b2` prefix since 2002.)\r\n\r\nAs you've no doubt noticed, the look of the site hasn't changed much. I tweaked a few things here and there, but for the most part just recreated the same template as what I had written for Wordpress. I am planning on a redesign eventually. For now, I wanted to spend my time developing the actual blog rather than screwing with CSS.\r\n\r\nSo, there you have it. [Everything is open source](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-vellum). Download it, fork it, hack it (and don't forget to send your code changes back my way). Let me know what you think. Build your own blog with it! (There's even a [script to import data from Wordpress](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-vellum/blob/master/vellum/management/commands/wordpress_import.py).) I think it's pretty sweet. The only thing lacking is documentation, and that's my next goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisqus\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe biggest change for the user is probably the comments, which are now powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). Consider it a trial. I've seen Disqus popping up on a number of sites the past year or so. At first it annoyed me, mostly because I use [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) and did not want to enable JavaScript for another domain just to comment on a site. But after I got over that I found that Disqus wasn't too bad. As a user I found it to be on par with the standard comment systems provided by Wordpress, Blogger, and the like. The extra features don't appeal to me. But as an administrator, Disqus appeals to me more because it means that I no longer have to manage comments myself! And as a developer, I'm attracted to [some of the things](http://blog.disqus.com/post/3879996850/scaling-disqus-at-pycon-2011) that Disqus has done (they're a Python shop, and run on top of Django) and their [open source contributions](https://github.com/disqus).\r\n\r\nSo I'm giving it a shot. Disqus will happily export comments, so if I (or you) decide that I don't like it, it will be easy to move to another system.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarkdown\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOne final note: I like [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). That might be an understatement.\r\n\r\nI first starting using Markdown on [GitHub](https://github.com), which I signed up for about the same time I started with Django and Python. After learning the [syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and playing with it for a few weeks, I discovered that I had a very hard time writing prose in anything else. In fact, the desire to write blog posts in Markdown was probably the biggest factor that influenced me to get off my butt and move away from Wordpress.\r\n\r\nSo, I incorporated Markdown into the blog. But rather than just making the blog Markdown-only, I took a hint from Mingus and included [django-markup](https://github.com/bartTC/django-markup), which supports rendering in many [lightweight markup languages](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language).\r\n\r\nBecause I'm still new to Markdown and occasionally cannot remember the correct syntax, I wanted to include some version of WMD. WMD is a [What You See Is What You Mean](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/WYSIWYM) editor for Markdown, a sort of alternative to [WYSIWYG](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors like TinyMCE. (It is my believe that WYSIWYG editors are one of the worst things to happen to the Internet.) All WMD consists of is a JavaScript library. The original was written by a guy named John Fraser, who was abducted by aliens some time in 2008. Since his disappearance from the interwebs, WMD has been forked countless times. I looked around at a few found a version that I was happy with (which happens to be a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork), and rolled it into [a reusable app](https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wmd). While I was at it, I made some visual changes to the editing area for the post body. The result is an attractive post editing area that is simple to use and produces clean code. I think it is much better than what is offered by Wordpress."

(There&#8217;s even a <a href="https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-vellum/blob/master/vellum/management/commands/wordpress_import.py">script to import data from Wordpress</a>.) I think it&#8217;s pretty sweet. The only thing lacking is documentation, and that&#8217;s my next goal.</p>\n<h2>Disqus</h2>\n<p>The biggest change for the user is probably the comments, which are now powered by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. Consider it a trial. I&#8217;ve seen Disqus popping up on a number of sites the past year or so. At first it annoyed me, mostly because I use <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> and did not want to enable JavaScript for another domain just to comment on a site. But after I got over that I found that Disqus wasn&#8217;t too bad. As a user I found it to be on par with the standard comment systems provided by Wordpress, Blogger, and the like. The extra features don&#8217;t appeal to me. But as an administrator, Disqus appeals to me more because it means that I no longer have to manage comments myself! And as a developer, I&#8217;m attracted to <a href="http://blog.disqus.com/post/3879996850/scaling-disqus-at-pycon-2011">some of the things</a> that Disqus has done (they&#8217;re a Python shop, and run on top of Django) and their <a href="https://github.com/disqus">open source contributions</a>.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m giving it a shot. Disqus will happily export comments, so if I (or you) decide that I don&#8217;t like it, it will be easy to move to another system.</p>\n<h2>Markdown</h2>\n<p>One final note: I like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. That might be an understatement.</p>\n<p>I first starting using Markdown on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which I signed up for about the same time I started with Django and Python. After learning the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> and playing with it for a few weeks, I discovered that I had a very hard time writing prose in anything else. In fact, the desire to write blog posts in Markdown was probably the biggest factor that influenced me to get off my butt and move away from Wordpress.</p>\n<p>So, I incorporated Markdown into the blog. But rather than just making the blog Markdown-only, I took a hint from Mingus and included <a href="https://github.com/bartTC/django-markup">django-markup</a>, which supports rendering in many <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages</a>.</p>\n<p>Because I&#8217;m still new to Markdown and occasionally cannot remember the correct syntax, I wanted to include some version of WMD. WMD is a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/WYSIWYM">What You See Is What You Mean</a> editor for Markdown, a sort of alternative to <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editors like TinyMCE. (It is my believe that WYSIWYG editors are one of the worst things to happen to the Internet.) All WMD consists of is a JavaScript library. The original was written by a guy named John Fraser, who was abducted by aliens some time in 2008. Since his disappearance from the interwebs, WMD has been forked countless times. I looked around at a few found a version that I was happy with (which happens to be a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork), and rolled it into <a href="https://github.com/pigmonkey/django-wmd">a reusable app</a>. While I was at it, I made some visual changes to the editing area for the post body. The result is an attractive post editing area that is simple to use and produces clean code. I think it is much better than what is offered by Wordpress.</p>'

    vellum_post_23.body = u'For the past few years I have been using a cheap headlight from <a href="http://www.cateye.com/">Cateye</a> on the front of my bike. When turned on to the blink setting, it did an acceptable job of making me seen, but it did very little to light up the road. Last January I decided that I wanted to replace or supplement it with a better light.\n\nI looked at the lights carried by various bike shops for a while, but none of them impressed me. The high end bike-specific lights are bright, to be sure, but they tend to be much more expensive than a hand-held light of comparable output.\n\nI thought it would be neat if I could somehow attach a normal light to my handlebars. Not only would this be cheaper than purchasing the equivalent bike headlight, but the light would be multifunctional: appropriate either for my bike or my belt. None of my own hackish attempts to mount a normal light on the handlebars satisfied me, so it was with relief that I heard about a company called <a href="http://www.twofish.biz/">Twofish</a>.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.twofish.biz/">Twofish</a> -- not the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Twofish">cipher</a> -- is a company that makes <a href="http://www.twofish.biz/bike.html">a series of mounting devices for bikes</a>. The two products that I purchased are the Lockblock and Bikeblock.\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5463188662/" title="Lockblock by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5463188662_2c62968c45_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Lockblock" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5462583589/" title="Bikeblock by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5462583589_83aa58cc53_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Bikeblock" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\nThe Lockblock is a piece of rubber with perpendicular "U"s on either side. Each side fastens to an object with a small piece of hook-and-loop webbing. The Bikeblock is similar, but the two "U"s are parallel, and each side fastens to its respective object with a single continuous piece of hook-and-loop webbing. Lockblocks are to be used when you want to mount an object perpendicular to something else, such as a light on handlebars. Bikeblocks are appropriate when you want to mount the object parallel to something else, such as a pump to a frame. I bought three of each.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5463206866/" title="Empty Lockblocks by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5133/5463206866_11f5803a1f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Empty Lockblocks" /></a>\n\nMy first use of the Lockblock was to replace the Cateye headlight with my old <a href="http://www.novatac.com/products.html">Novatac 120T</a>.

    vellum_post_25.body = u'Arriving at Rialto Beach just past 1:00 PM, I took a few minutes to stuff my food into the bear can I had borrowed from the Ranger Station on my way out. The cans are required to keep food secure not from bears, but from marauding raccoons. This was to be the third year I had hiked the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Olympic_National_Park#Coastline">Olympic Coast</a> in Winter and, outside of the Sierra Nevada, these have been the only times I\'ve carried a bear can. Still, thanks to the warmer temperatures along the coast, even with the can my pack feels light compared to what I must carry this time of year when high in the mountains.\n\nHigh tide had been at 11:30 AM. It is still high enough to make beach-walking difficult. I opt to make my way through the thick trees and marsh instead of braving the beach. There are no cars in the parking lot when I leave, but I surprise two people panning for gold along a small creek. Neither are talkative. When I ask if they had found anything, the one only replies "a little". I don\'t know if that is the truth, or if he was just anxious to get me gone.\n\nI spend an hour in the woods. The tide is low enough now that I can make my way down to the beach, exchanging thick trees for wet sand. Occasionally I have to run up the beach and jump on top of driftwood to escape from the occasional wave, but for the most part the way is easy going between Rialto and Hole-in-the-Wall.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5382870185/" title="Rialto Beach by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5130/5382870185_96c044d44b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Rialto Beach" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe area is thick with Bald Eagles. Every 15 minutes or so I spot one in a tree, or landing on a sea stack, or one flying over the ocean. At one point I see two eagles eating on a large fish head that had washed up on the beach. (I don\'t know what kind of fish, but the head was close to the size of a football.) The two are eating just on the other side of a large boulder. We don\'t notice each other until I come around the rock, at which point they jump and fly off. At a distance of about 10 feet, that\'s the closest I have ever been to an eagle.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5383477826/" title="Bald Eagle by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5006/5383477826_00c4b20867_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Bald Eagle" /></a>\n\nAt Hole-in-the-Wall, the sandy beach comes to an end for a good while. Now begins the obstacle course that defines a walk along the wild coast. Piles of driftwood, tide pools, slippery rocks, and tall headlands all present a much different challenge from the steady plodding that characterizes walking in the mountains. The various balancing tricks, pull ups and push ups that are required make one thankful for a well packed backpack.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5383494198/" title="Tide Carved Rocks by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5089/5383494198_a1cb2219d7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Tide Carved Rocks" /></a>\n\nAfter rounding one headland I come upon two deer, out looking for whatever seafood it is that deer fancy. They don\'t seem too concerned about me, but eventually bound up the steep cliff as I close in.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5383497104/" title="Deer on the Beach by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5383497104_499d75ee54_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Deer on the Beach" /></a>\n\nAround the next headland there\'s an octopus lying in the sand. It has been partially eaten by something.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5382903125/" title="Octopus by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5048/5382903125_cc61c4385e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Octopus" /></a>\n\nThe tide is out now. I walk blissfully along a rare sandy stretch of beach that doesn\'t require much attention, and find myself surprised by a dark brown spot ahead of me. My first thought is Marmot, but they belong in the mountains, not the coast. Then I think Badger, but the tail is wrong and they also had no business on the coast. An Otter! I couldn\'t identify it at first, as I had no experience to link it to. This was the first time I had seen an Otter -- leastwise, on land and in the wild.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5383520124/" title="Sea Otter by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5383520124_72f1317484_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sea Otter" /></a>\n\nThe Otter is slowly flopping down the beach, throwing his front arms forward and then pulling along the rest of his body. His legs wiggle a bit but are clearly useless on land. I approach slowly. He turns his head and looks at me, slows and then finally stops as I approach. I don\'t know if he isn\'t concerned by my presence, or if he is tired from inefficient land movement. Perhaps he thinks the best course of action is to play (sorta) dead.\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=c07fe730d8&photo_id=5382737679"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=c07fe730d8&photo_id=5382737679" height="300" width="400"></embed></object></li>\n\t<li><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=fe4e8259e4&photo_id=5383472938"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=fe4e8259e4&photo_id=5383472938" height="300" width="400"></embed></object></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\nI\'m able to get within four feet of the Otter, where I stop to admire his fur and watch his whiskers twitch as he sniffs me. It would be easy to approach close enough to touch him -- a tempting thought -- but I don\'t think he\'ll appreciate that. Instead I try to make conversation. "Hey, you\'re a mammal. I\'m a mammal. We both have nipples." At this the Otter\'s concern seems to grow, so I leave him and continue around the next headland. I don\'t want him to have to cut short his time on the beach on my account.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5383529828/" title="Sea Otter by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5284/5383529828_b5972ae38c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sea Otter" /></a>\n\nMy tide chart has sunset scheduled for 5:00 PM, which is drawing near. I\'m still in an area with the ocean on my left and sharp cliffs on my right. The map shows that it is a long way to the next suitable camp spot. I resign myself to hiking for a short while in the dark. At least the tide won\'t be coming in till 7:00 PM.\n\nI walk along, and watch the sun set over the edge of the world.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5383541984/" title="Sunset over the Pacific by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5005/5383541984_dfcb67a8c0_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sunset over the Pacific" /></a>\n\nAt 6:00 PM I come to an area where the cliffs on my right give way to a clump of trees. I make my way inside and find a spot to pitch the tarp. After dinner in the dark, I crawl into my bag and go to sleep. The roaring of the tide wakes me once around midnight, but, unlike the last time I spent the night out here, my camp tonight is well above the high tide mark.\n\nThe tide gives me trouble the next day. It is about an hour later than the day before, with high tide hitting at 12:30 PM. I was hoping to wake up early and log a few miles at low tide around 6:30 AM, but I end up not waking till 9 AM. At that point the tide is high enough that I could barely get anywhere before high tide, at which point I would be able to go nowhere at all. I decide not to make any move until after high tide, though that means a later start than yesterday, and so a longer hike into the night.\n\nIt is a gray morning. Rain steadily falls from the sky, coupling with the ocean mist to give all a good soaking. I lie about, enjoy a slow breakfast, read some and write some. By 1:00 PM my patience is gone and I decide to see if any progress can be made. After breaking camp I find that I can scale partway up the cliff that starts on the north edge of my clump of trees, and traverse along that a way. From there I\'m able to hop along a few large boulders that stick up out of the ocean, but I can\'t get far. Eventually I have to stop and sit out the tide atop a group of rocks. It always goes out slower when you\'re waiting for it.\n\nAn hour passes and the tide has gone down far enough that there are occasional stretches of bare sand between waves. This allows me some progress. I watch the waves go up and down for a minute, try to get a feel for the timing, and dash along the briefly-bare beach, clambering up the next pile of driftwood or large boulder before the waves come. Sometimes I make it, sometimes the waves catch me. More than once I make it to the top of a rock, but the wave hits with enough force that the water bounces up and splashes me. I\'m wet already from the rain, so in the end it makes little difference.\n\nThe gray morning turns into a gray afternoon, which passes without difference. I don\'t notice it getting dark until only a few minutes before sunset. I\'m no more than halfway to where I want to be, but why pack a headlamp if you\'re not going to use it? The next two hours are spent along the usual obstacle course of driftwood, headlands, and barnacle covered rocks, made even more interesting due to the dark. But after I pass them, the last hour and a half is along another rare stretch of sandy beach. I make up for lost time by running stretches. With a pack on my back and soft sand underfoot, running is a challenge, but it keeps me warm. Still, I don\'t arrive into camp till 8:30 PM.\n\nThe rain continues into the next morning. I breakfast on the westernmost point in the contiguous US, turn south, and retrace my steps for a couple days back to Rialto Beach.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5382932013/" title="Tidepools and Headlands by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5382932013_e96d40c17d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Tidepools and Headlands" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>"In the static mode an observer may unify the pieces of a puzzle, but only as a blueprint -- kinetics adds the third dimension of depth, and the fourth of history.

I make my way inside and find a spot to pitch the tarp. After dinner in the dark, I crawl into my bag and go to sleep. The roaring of the tide wakes me once around midnight, but, unlike the last time I spent the night out here, my camp tonight is well above the high tide mark.</p>\n<p>The tide gives me trouble the next day. It is about an hour later than the day before, with high tide hitting at 12:30 PM. I was hoping to wake up early and log a few miles at low tide around 6:30 AM, but I end up not waking till 9 AM. At that point the tide is high enough that I could barely get anywhere before high tide, at which point I would be able to go nowhere at all. I decide not to make any move until after high tide, though that means a later start than yesterday, and so a longer hike into the night.</p>\n<p>It is a gray morning. Rain steadily falls from the sky, coupling with the ocean mist to give all a good soaking. I lie about, enjoy a slow breakfast, read some and write some. By 1:00 PM my patience is gone and I decide to see if any progress can be made. After breaking camp I find that I can scale partway up the cliff that starts on the north edge of my clump of trees, and traverse along that a way. From there I&#8217;m able to hop along a few large boulders that stick up out of the ocean, but I can&#8217;t get far. Eventually I have to stop and sit out the tide atop a group of rocks. It always goes out slower when you&#8217;re waiting for it.</p>\n<p>An hour passes and the tide has gone down far enough that there are occasional stretches of bare sand between waves. This allows me some progress. I watch the waves go up and down for a minute, try to get a feel for the timing, and dash along the briefly-bare beach, clambering up the next pile of driftwood or large boulder before the waves come. Sometimes I make it, sometimes the waves catch me. More than once I make it to the top of a rock, but the wave hits with enough force that the water bounces up and splashes me. I&#8217;m wet already from the rain, so in the end it makes little difference.</p>\n<p>The gray morning turns into a gray afternoon, which passes without difference. I don&#8217;t notice it getting dark until only a few minutes before sunset. I&#8217;m no more than halfway to where I want to be, but why pack a headlamp if you&#8217;re not going to use it? The next two hours are spent along the usual obstacle course of driftwood, headlands, and barnacle covered rocks, made even more interesting due to the dark. But after I pass them, the last hour and a half is along another rare stretch of sandy beach. I make up for lost time by running stretches. With a pack on my back and soft sand underfoot, running is a challenge, but it keeps me warm. Still, I don&#8217;t arrive into camp till 8:30 PM.</p>\n<p>The rain continues into the next morning. I breakfast on the westernmost point in the contiguous US, turn south, and retrace my steps for a couple days back to Rialto Beach.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5382932013/" title="Tidepools and Headlands by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5382932013_e96d40c17d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Tidepools and Headlands" /></a>\n<blockquote>&#8220;In the static mode an observer may unify the pieces of a puzzle, but only as a blueprint &#8212; kinetics adds the third dimension of depth, and the fourth of history.

It seemed like a good idea -- I knew I wanted some sort of database to store my measured weights and other notes in -- but I never got around to updating it. Data in a spreadsheet is too static. You can\'t do much with it. I think that characteristic contributed to my disinterest with the spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nSo for a while now I\'ve had the idea of writing a web application to track my gear. Over the past week, I finally got around to doing it.\r\n\r\nGear Tracker is built on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, a web application framework. (If you\'re not familiar with Django, and you have anything to do with making websites, it\'s probably worth your time to <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/">learn a thing or two</a>.)\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<h2>Gear</h2>\r\n\r\nGear Tracker\'s primary purpose is to track gear.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/media/geartracker/images/demo/admin-item.png"><img src="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/media/geartracker/images/demo/admin-item_thumb.png" alt="Screenshot of item admin" /></a>\r\n\r\nEach item has a weight and acquisition date associated with it. It can be categorized, tagged, and related to other items. There are fields to input size, a link to the manufacturer\'s page, a link to a review, and to upload an image. A text area allows the user to store any notes related to the item.\r\n\r\nItems can be archived. This provides a way to not list gear that the user no longer owns, but to keep it in the database for future reference of its weight or other attributes.\r\n\r\n<h3>Weights</h3>\r\n\r\nWeights are always input in grams.\r\n\r\nThe metric system makes the most sense and is the easiest to work with. An item\'s weight can be displayed in grams or, if the item weighs more than 1,000 grams, kilograms. But because some of us are crippled and still like to see imperial weights, Gear Tracker can also display the item\'s weight in ounces or pounds.\r\n\r\n<h2>Gear Lists</h2>\r\n\r\nGear Tracker can also generate gear lists.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that has prevented me from doing many gear lists in the past is that they\'re a pain in the rear to create. It takes a while to manually write out every item of gear that I take on a trip. If I want to add the weight of each item -- well, that\'s asking too much! It\'s not worth it.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/media/geartracker/images/demo/admin-gear_list.png"><img src="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/media/geartracker/images/demo/admin-gear_list_thumb.png" alt="Screenshot of gear list admin" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow, making gear lists is easy. Gear Tracker already has detailed knowledge about each piece of gear. All it takes to create a gear list is to select the item, specify how many of that item I took, and whether the item was packed or carried. The result is an organized, detailed gear list for every trip. Total weights are calculated, of course, and can be output in either metric or imperial units.\r\n\r\n<h3>Private Gear Lists</h3>\r\n\r\nGear lists can be made private.\r\n\r\nI generally create gear lists when I\'m packing before a trip. But I don\'t like to publish the lists until I actually return from the trip and also have a report and photos for people to peruse. So, Gear Tracker allows a gear list to be marked as private.\r\n\r\n<h2>Download It, Hack It, Use It</h2>\r\n\r\nI\'m running Gear Tracker at <a href="http://gear.pig-monkey.com/">gear.pig-monkey.com</a>, but if you want to grab your own copy and run it yourself, you can!

The plan was to start out on the Enchantment-area trail to Eightmile lake, take the junction west to Lake Caroline, and head on over Windy Pass, which forms the boundary between the Enchantments and the normal Alpine Lakes Wilderness. I would be in the restricted area for about 6 miles. As I had assumed, day use permits for the Enchantments were available at the trailhead. But normal permits for the Alpine Lakes Wilderness? Of course not! I was slightly perturbed. It wasn\'t as if I was planning a cross country trip. I was going in on a trail that started here, at this very trailhead, and continued straight through the Enchantments into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Why would they not have permits for the Alpine Lakes here? Is the Forest Service operating under the assumption that nobody is going to <em>walk over Windy Pass on the trail that the Forest Service maintains for that very purpose</em>? Must be. No matter. I wouldn\'t feel right about letting a little thing like legality get in the way of my rambling. I took a day use permit and filled it out for the Enchantment part of the trip.

I ran out of room, so I tore out a few pieces of paper from my journal and attached them. With my public service done for the day, I hit the trail.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024986660/" title="Alpine Lakes Wilderness by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4086/5024986660_8dbdbd184b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Alpine Lakes Wilderness" /></a>\n\nI had gotten to the trailhead later than planned, and the permit fiasco set me back a bit further. Since I couldn\'t legally sleep till I gained Windy Pass, I set a quick pace and was unable to enjoy much of the Enchantments.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024382297/" title="No Fires Above 5,000 ft. by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5024382297_926793f874_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="No Fires Above 5,000 ft." /></a>\n\nI slowed as I neared the pass. The trail climbing up takes a meandering route through the beautiful basin.

I was now safely out of the Enchantments and could once again safely sleep wherever I wished. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:signs"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:signs" title="see footnote">2</a></sup> It is a comfort.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024395477/" title="Cascade Crest from Windy Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/5024395477_553f4a5aa4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Cascade Crest from Windy Pass" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024397039/" title="View from Windy Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4086/5024397039_ffc75105a5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="View from Windy Pass" /></a>\n\nThe trail on the west side of Windy Pass is starkly different from the east. It takes a much narrower and steeper path, heading directly down. Starting in alpine meadows, it quickly enters into forests that continue for the remainder of the descent. It had been sunny and dry the whole day, but the thick bush was still covered in dew, wetting my pants. I was grateful for my gaiters.\n\nInitially I had thought to aim for Trout Lake and make my camp there. But at 7PM I was still north of it. The sun was due to set in another half hour. I decided to camp in a clearing and visit the lake for breakfast the following morning.\n\nI woke once during the night. The thermometer read 25&#176;F.\n\nIt seemed like a good morning to sleep in, so I did. I crawled out of the bag at 9:00 AM and left camp a half hour later.\n\nIt turns out I was only a mile north of Trout Lake. When I arrived the sun was just climbing over the ridge in the east, melting the frost off the lake\'s surrounding meadow, filling the air with mist. A fine start to the equinox.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024402227/" title="Morning Frost at Trout Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5024402227_3fec961e7f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Morning Frost at Trout Lake" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024404821/" title="Rising Sun at Trout Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/5024404821_921c26f52e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Rising Sun at Trout Lake" /></a>\n\nI attempted to make a breakfast of oatmeal with chia seeds, but accidentally dumped in most of the bag of chia seeds. Breakfast became chia seeds with oatmeal.\n\nWith the meal finished and the sun climbing high, it was time for me to continue west. The climb to the top of Jack Ridge offered splendid views of the Trout Creek valley, back towards Windy Pass, and the many peaks of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5025018362/" title="South from Jack Rdige by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5025018362_5ba7500dbe_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="South from Jack Rdige" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024415777/" title="Trout Lake from Jack Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/5024415777_aed3339e1f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Trout Lake from Jack Ridge" /></a>\n\nAt the top of the ridge the obvious tread continued south. Had I looked at my map I would have seen that the real trail turns sharply north before beginning its descent down the opposite side -- but why take out a map when there is fine tread below my feet?\n\nI lost the trail shortly and decided that it must have been only a game trail. Turning back to scout out the proper path was the obvious solution, but backtracking always seems depressing. Besides, I only needed to descend into the valley on the opposite side of the ridge till I reached Jack Creek and the obvious trail that parallels it. I would make my own way.\n\nAt first I was able to find other game trails that seemed to be heading down. But the trouble with deer is that they don\'t organize themselves into trail crews to maintain their highways. The paths always petered out. I soon gave up on them in favor of a more direct descent. It was steep, and lacking a trail, I have the tendency to always aim for a direct descent (or ascent, as the case may be), making nary a switchback.\n\nThe areas thick with trees slowed progress further. I was glad when I reached a small open meadow. Until I was stung by a bee. At that point my gladness evaporated. I retreated back to the trees. Having been stung before and never experiencing a reaction, I wasn\'t much concerned, but the venom still hurt.\n\nThe descent continued. I soon noticed that when I clenched my left hand there was some tightness on the outside, near where I had been stung. It was not yet visible, but the area was clearly swelling. There was nothing to do but continue the descent.\n\nThe last stage was the steepest. I often fell and slid down on my rear. Two hours after I had left the top of the ridge I spotted a man with a rifle and orange hat. He yelled a hello. I return the greeting and commented that he must be on the trail. The hunter replied with a thumbs up.\n\nIt was good to be back on trail. We chatted while I recovered my breath and sucked down a bit of water. Apparently it was high buck season. The hunter lamented that his ruck was much too heavy for this trip. I observed that he still had to pack out the meat -- or, at least, hopefully he would. Luckily he had two friends further ahead of him that could help with that job.\n\nNow on the Jack Creek trail, I turned south and resumed my walk. At the junction with Meadow Creek I stopped for lunch and water. My hand was now visibly swollen, but I experienced no other symptoms. The swelling did not appear to be traveling up my arm. To be safe I switched my watch and paracord bracelet to the other wrist. Gazing at the contrast between my two hands, I thought it funny, like I was slowly (or perhaps quickly) becoming fat. Anyway, the hand still worked fine, doing everything that a hand is supposed to do, so I wasn\'t worried.\n\nThat afternoon I only traveled a few miles further, a bit past the junction with Van Epps Creek. It didn\'t make much mileage for the day, but I was tired from the journey down the ridge, and unsure if there would be any decent spots to camp till the opposite side of the upcoming pass.\n\nOff to one side of the trail was a burned area where I was able to find a decently flat spot for the tarp. I enjoyed dinner while watching the sun set in the west, taking with it the last few moments of this year\'s summer. It had been well spent, I thought. I brought to mind <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/20/a-few-days-in-the-glacier-peak-wilderness/">waking up in the Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>, with the valleys below me filled with clouds and only the snow-capped peaks visible above. Or throwing my bedroll in the dust in the high country of Oregon\'s Cascades, spending the whole night watching the Perseid meteor shower, tossing <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em> back and forth across camp. Or <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/11/a-week-in-the-wenaha-tucannon-wilderness/">yelling at bears down by the Tucannon</a>.\n\nCamp was at a lower elevation that night, and I slept warmer. But the dry spell was broke by a light morning rain. It didn\'t matter: Jack Creek was running a hundred feet from my camp and had to be forded first thing, so I was getting wet anyway.\n\nOn the other side I exchanged sandals for boots (tying my shoe laces with one still swollen hand). The rain had stopped, but the forest was still damp. I kept my rain gear on.\n\nThe trail crossed back to the other side of the creek, then started heading up, aiming for Stuart Pass. It was forested, providing few views of the destination, until a sudden break provided a stunning view of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mount_Stuart">Mount Stuart</a>. "Well, shit," I thought. I\'ve seen a lot of mountains, but Stuart is an awesome sight. One of the largest pieces of exposed granite in the States, carved by multiple ice ages, the only way to describe it is rugged. I had a strong temptation to abandon the trail for the mountain, but time -- or, rather, my food supply -- was against me. I continued on up to the pass.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024410123/" title="Stuart Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5024410123_c50aedebb6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Stuart Pass" /></a>\n\nStuart pass connects Mount Stuart to neighboring Ingalls Peak, but by the time I reached the top, clouds had rolled in and obscured both mountains. Snow began to fall. I sat down for a congratulatory lunch.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024412027/" title="Mount Stuart by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5024412027_fe0ac02d5f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Mount Stuart" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5025025342/" title="Ingalls Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/5025025342_acb59fc16a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Ingalls Peak" /></a>\n\nI was nearly out of the wilderness now, with nothing left to do but descend the pass and walk through the 20 mile valley of Ingalls Creek. I thought I would do only a few more miles today, and save the bulk for tomorrow. But after I left the pass the flatness of the terrain deceived me. At 4:00 PM I was only 5 miles from the end. Not wanting to end the trip that early, I stopped at the next likely spot and made camp, settling in for another warm night.\n\nThe sun wakened the valley in the morning, a welcome change from yesterday\'s clouds and rain. I set out a few things to dry while the oats boiled and decided to enjoy a bit more of my book before breaking camp.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024474885/" title="Dawn on Ingalls Creek by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5024474885_6362959c5b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Dawn on Ingalls Creek" /></a>\n\nThe last few miles of trail went quickly. I arrived at the trailhead at noon, but the trip wasn\'t over: this <em>wasn\'t</em> the trailhead where I had parked. The trip was a one way hike, not a loop. So I walked out the small road to where it met <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/U.S._Route_97">US 97</a> in one mile, stuck out my thumb, and began the second stage of the journey.\n\nHitchhiking is a completely different experience from wilderness rambling. I\'m at ease with solo travel in the middle of nowhere, depending only on myself. I know what I can do, what I can\'t do, and I\'m comfortable betting my life on it. But thumbing my way down the highway is the opposite. I barely factor into the equation. Instead I\'m completely dependent on everybody else.\n\nBefore reaching the highway I had put away my trekking pole and taken off the rain gear that I had been forced to wear down the wet trail. This, I hoped, would make me look a bit more normal. Perhaps it worked. I only had my thumb out for 10 minutes before a middle aged couple pulled over and asked me where I was headed. I told them Leavenworth, which is about 8 miles north on US 97 and then 10 or 12 miles west on <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/U.S._Route_2">US 2</a>. They were going to head east on US 2, but offered to take me up to the junction.\n\nThey were Seattleites, heading to the east side to escape the rain for a few days. Both were interested in my travels, so I told them a few tales. When we reached US 2 the driver said he\'d head into Leavenworth and drop me off wherever I wanted. Great! That was the bulk of the trip over with. Initially I hadn\'t been sure how long it would take me to get back into Leavenworth. I planned for an extra day or two in case I needed to stealth camp along the highway, but now it looked like I would reach my own car that same day.\n\nI was dropped off at the western edge of town. Now I had to get 8 miles down Icicle Creek Road. The first mile or two consisted of suburbs, but after that it was only a small country road. I somewhat doubted my chances of getting a ride all the way.\n\nThe second ride took longer. This time a whole 15 minutes before a pickup truck stopped. The driver was an old man, probably in his eighties, blasting music from a country music station. After I hopped in I discovered that the seat belt on the passenger side was broken. Whoops.\n\nI had to strain to make out anything he said. He offered me a bottle of whiskey, saying it would keep me warm, but I told him it wasn\'t that cold yet. Then he said something about getting me a woman, ogling at a jogger on the side of the road.\n\nEventually I made out that he lived just a couple miles down the road. He\'d just gone into town for the whiskey and was on his way back. But he too decided to go out of his way to drop me off 8 miles down the road. I decided I must be a pretty ok guy.\n\nI had first stuck my thumb out on US 97 two hours ago and was almost at my destination. This last bit was a small, dirt Forest Service road. I doubted if I\'d see any cars going in the right direction, but it was only 3 miles and a few thousand feet to the car. I didn\'t mind the walk.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024478867/" title="End of the Road by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5024478867_351a28c359_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="End of the Road" /></a>\n\nA little over halfway I passed a group of guys chopping wood at the side of the road. "That looks like a lot of work," I said. "I think I\'ll just keep on walking." One of them joked that he\'d give me a ride back down if I wanted to help, but I told him my car was at the top of the hill. "I need a ride in the other direction!" The man replied that they were almost done with the wood and he\'d give me a ride up there anyway, but I only had another mile to go and was enjoying the walk. I declined.\n\nThree hours and about 30 miles after leaving the wilderness I was back at the car.\n\n<div id="footnotes">\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id="fn:permits"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:permits" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> Regardless of the benefits of permits, or the political ideas behind them, I find them to be completely impractical for wilderness areas. Controlling people in cars is easy, since, for the most part, they\'re limited to roads. But controlling people on foot? Not so much. (Hence why I equate mobility with freedom.) You can place a permit station at the trailheads closest to the area you want to control. That covers people driving to it. And how about those of us who walk in? Now you need permit stations on every trail leading into the area. But wait! Why assume that foot travelers are limited to trail? To effectively control access, you either need to have permit stations dotted across the entire border every quarter mile or so, or you need to surround the area with a large, unscalable wall or fence with only a select few entrances. Impractical, you say? I agree. (Incidentally, the same thing goes for national borders. They seem to operate on the premise that everybody trying to cross will do so on the roads that you ask them to cross on.

A fine start to the equinox.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024402227/" title="Morning Frost at Trout Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5024402227_3fec961e7f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Morning Frost at Trout Lake" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024404821/" title="Rising Sun at Trout Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/5024404821_921c26f52e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Rising Sun at Trout Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>I attempted to make a breakfast of oatmeal with chia seeds, but accidentally dumped in most of the bag of chia seeds. Breakfast became chia seeds with oatmeal.</p>\n<p>With the meal finished and the sun climbing high, it was time for me to continue west. The climb to the top of Jack Ridge offered splendid views of the Trout Creek valley, back towards Windy Pass, and the many peaks of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5025018362/" title="South from Jack Rdige by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5025018362_5ba7500dbe_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="South from Jack Rdige" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024415777/" title="Trout Lake from Jack Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/5024415777_aed3339e1f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Trout Lake from Jack Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>At the top of the ridge the obvious tread continued south. Had I looked at my map I would have seen that the real trail turns sharply north before beginning its descent down the opposite side &#8212; but why take out a map when there is fine tread below my feet?</p>\n<p>I lost the trail shortly and decided that it must have been only a game trail. Turning back to scout out the proper path was the obvious solution, but backtracking always seems depressing. Besides, I only needed to descend into the valley on the opposite side of the ridge till I reached Jack Creek and the obvious trail that parallels it. I would make my own way.</p>\n<p>At first I was able to find other game trails that seemed to be heading down. But the trouble with deer is that they don&#8217;t organize themselves into trail crews to maintain their highways. The paths always petered out. I soon gave up on them in favor of a more direct descent. It was steep, and lacking a trail, I have the tendency to always aim for a direct descent (or ascent, as the case may be), making nary a switchback.</p>\n<p>The areas thick with trees slowed progress further. I was glad when I reached a small open meadow. Until I was stung by a bee. At that point my gladness evaporated. I retreated back to the trees. Having been stung before and never experiencing a reaction, I wasn&#8217;t much concerned, but the venom still hurt.</p>\n<p>The descent continued. I soon noticed that when I clenched my left hand there was some tightness on the outside, near where I had been stung. It was not yet visible, but the area was clearly swelling. There was nothing to do but continue the descent.</p>\n<p>The last stage was the steepest. I often fell and slid down on my rear. Two hours after I had left the top of the ridge I spotted a man with a rifle and orange hat. He yelled a hello. I return the greeting and commented that he must be on the trail. The hunter replied with a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>It was good to be back on trail. We chatted while I recovered my breath and sucked down a bit of water. Apparently it was high buck season. The hunter lamented that his ruck was much too heavy for this trip. I observed that he still had to pack out the meat &#8212; or, at least, hopefully he would. Luckily he had two friends further ahead of him that could help with that job.</p>\n<p>Now on the Jack Creek trail, I turned south and resumed my walk. At the junction with Meadow Creek I stopped for lunch and water. My hand was now visibly swollen, but I experienced no other symptoms. The swelling did not appear to be traveling up my arm. To be safe I switched my watch and paracord bracelet to the other wrist. Gazing at the contrast between my two hands, I thought it funny, like I was slowly (or perhaps quickly) becoming fat. Anyway, the hand still worked fine, doing everything that a hand is supposed to do, so I wasn&#8217;t worried.</p>\n<p>That afternoon I only traveled a few miles further, a bit past the junction with Van Epps Creek. It didn&#8217;t make much mileage for the day, but I was tired from the journey down the ridge, and unsure if there would be any decent spots to camp till the opposite side of the upcoming pass.</p>\n<p>Off to one side of the trail was a burned area where I was able to find a decently flat spot for the tarp. I enjoyed dinner while watching the sun set in the west, taking with it the last few moments of this year&#8217;s summer. It had been well spent, I thought. I brought to mind <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/20/a-few-days-in-the-glacier-peak-wilderness/">waking up in the Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>, with the valleys below me filled with clouds and only the snow-capped peaks visible above. Or throwing my bedroll in the dust in the high country of Oregon&#8217;s Cascades, spending the whole night watching the Perseid meteor shower, tossing <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em> back and forth across camp. Or <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/11/a-week-in-the-wenaha-tucannon-wilderness/">yelling at bears down by the Tucannon</a>.</p>\n<p>Camp was at a lower elevation that night, and I slept warmer. But the dry spell was broke by a light morning rain. It didn&#8217;t matter: Jack Creek was running a hundred feet from my camp and had to be forded first thing, so I was getting wet anyway.</p>\n<p>On the other side I exchanged sandals for boots (tying my shoe laces with one still swollen hand). The rain had stopped, but the forest was still damp. I kept my rain gear on.</p>\n<p>The trail crossed back to the other side of the creek, then started heading up, aiming for Stuart Pass. It was forested, providing few views of the destination, until a sudden break provided a stunning view of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mount_Stuart">Mount Stuart</a>. &#8220;Well, shit,&#8221; I thought. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of mountains, but Stuart is an awesome sight. One of the largest pieces of exposed granite in the States, carved by multiple ice ages, the only way to describe it is rugged. I had a strong temptation to abandon the trail for the mountain, but time &#8212; or, rather, my food supply &#8212; was against me. I continued on up to the pass.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024410123/" title="Stuart Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5024410123_c50aedebb6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Stuart Pass" /></a></p>\n<p>Stuart pass connects Mount Stuart to neighboring Ingalls Peak, but by the time I reached the top, clouds had rolled in and obscured both mountains. Snow began to fall. I sat down for a congratulatory lunch.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024412027/" title="Mount Stuart by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5024412027_fe0ac02d5f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Mount Stuart" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5025025342/" title="Ingalls Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/5025025342_acb59fc16a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Ingalls Peak" /></a></p>\n<p>I was nearly out of the wilderness now, with nothing left to do but descend the pass and walk through the 20 mile valley of Ingalls Creek. I thought I would do only a few more miles today, and save the bulk for tomorrow. But after I left the pass the flatness of the terrain deceived me. At 4:00 PM I was only 5 miles from the end. Not wanting to end the trip that early, I stopped at the next likely spot and made camp, settling in for another warm night.</p>\n<p>The sun wakened the valley in the morning, a welcome change from yesterday&#8217;s clouds and rain. I set out a few things to dry while the oats boiled and decided to enjoy a bit more of my book before breaking camp.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024474885/" title="Dawn on Ingalls Creek by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5024474885_6362959c5b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Dawn on Ingalls Creek" /></a></p>\n<p>The last few miles of trail went quickly. I arrived at the trailhead at noon, but the trip wasn&#8217;t over: this <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> the trailhead where I had parked. The trip was a one way hike, not a loop. So I walked out the small road to where it met <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/U.S._Route_97">US 97</a> in one mile, stuck out my thumb, and began the second stage of the journey.</p>\n<p>Hitchhiking is a completely different experience from wilderness rambling. I&#8217;m at ease with solo travel in the middle of nowhere, depending only on myself. I know what I can do, what I can&#8217;t do, and I&#8217;m comfortable betting my life on it. But thumbing my way down the highway is the opposite. I barely factor into the equation. Instead I&#8217;m completely dependent on everybody else.</p>\n<p>Before reaching the highway I had put away my trekking pole and taken off the rain gear that I had been forced to wear down the wet trail. This, I hoped, would make me look a bit more normal. Perhaps it worked. I only had my thumb out for 10 minutes before a middle aged couple pulled over and asked me where I was headed. I told them Leavenworth, which is about 8 miles north on US 97 and then 10 or 12 miles west on <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/U.S._Route_2">US 2</a>. They were going to head east on US 2, but offered to take me up to the junction.</p>\n<p>They were Seattleites, heading to the east side to escape the rain for a few days. Both were interested in my travels, so I told them a few tales. When we reached US 2 the driver said he&#8217;d head into Leavenworth and drop me off wherever I wanted. Great! That was the bulk of the trip over with. Initially I hadn&#8217;t been sure how long it would take me to get back into Leavenworth. I planned for an extra day or two in case I needed to stealth camp along the highway, but now it looked like I would reach my own car that same day.</p>\n<p>I was dropped off at the western edge of town. Now I had to get 8 miles down Icicle Creek Road. The first mile or two consisted of suburbs, but after that it was only a small country road. I somewhat doubted my chances of getting a ride all the way.</p>\n<p>The second ride took longer. This time a whole 15 minutes before a pickup truck stopped. The driver was an old man, probably in his eighties, blasting music from a country music station. After I hopped in I discovered that the seat belt on the passenger side was broken. Whoops.</p>\n<p>I had to strain to make out anything he said. He offered me a bottle of whiskey, saying it would keep me warm, but I told him it wasn&#8217;t that cold yet. Then he said something about getting me a woman, ogling at a jogger on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>Eventually I made out that he lived just a couple miles down the road. He&#8217;d just gone into town for the whiskey and was on his way back. But he too decided to go out of his way to drop me off 8 miles down the road. I decided I must be a pretty ok guy.</p>\n<p>I had first stuck my thumb out on US 97 two hours ago and was almost at my destination. This last bit was a small, dirt Forest Service road. I doubted if I&#8217;d see any cars going in the right direction, but it was only 3 miles and a few thousand feet to the car. I didn&#8217;t mind the walk.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/5024478867/" title="End of the Road by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5024478867_351a28c359_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="End of the Road" /></a></p>\n<p>A little over halfway I passed a group of guys chopping wood at the side of the road. &#8220;That looks like a lot of work,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll just keep on walking.&#8221; One of them joked that he&#8217;d give me a ride back down if I wanted to help, but I told him my car was at the top of the hill. &#8220;I need a ride in the other direction!&#8221; The man replied that they were almost done with the wood and he&#8217;d give me a ride up there anyway, but I only had another mile to go and was enjoying the walk. I declined.</p>\n<p>Three hours and about 30 miles after leaving the wilderness I was back at the car.</p>\n<div id="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:permits"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:permits" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> Regardless of the benefits of permits, or the political ideas behind them, I find them to be completely impractical for wilderness areas. Controlling people in cars is easy, since, for the most part, they&#8217;re limited to roads. But controlling people on foot? Not so much. (Hence why I equate mobility with freedom.) You can place a permit station at the trailheads closest to the area you want to control. That covers people driving to it. And how about those of us who walk in? Now you need permit stations on every trail leading into the area. But wait! Why assume that foot travelers are limited to trail? To effectively control access, you either need to have permit stations dotted across the entire border every quarter mile or so, or you need to surround the area with a large, unscalable wall or fence with only a select few entrances. Impractical, you say? I agree. (Incidentally, the same thing goes for national borders. They seem to operate on the premise that everybody trying to cross will do so on the roads that you ask them to cross on. As if people are sealed in their <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/05/09/stand-up-straight-and-walk/">tin cans</a> and can&#8217;t, you know, <em>walk</em>.</li>\n<li id="fn:signs"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:signs" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> Of course there were no signs up here, warning travelers heading in the other direction that they were now entering an area were they were not allowed to lay their head.

She had the excellent idea of using a spatula head to clean the pot. <a href="http://asthecrowflies.org/2006/10/24/simplistic-dining/">It\'s a simple system</a>:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Eat dinner out of pot</li>\n\t<li>Clean pot with spatula, licking food remnants off of spatula as you go</li>\n\t<li>Boil water in pot</li>\n\t<li>Pour heated water from pot into bottle for tea</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe pot is cleaned with the spatula. Afterward, boiling water in the pot helps to kill any nasties that might be hanging about.\n\nI discovered this idea on Crow\'s blog about a year ago. At first I took a small kitchen spatula and cut the handle off. It worked, but there was about 2" of the plastic handle inside of the head that couldn\'t be removed, which translated to dead weight. Later I discovered that people actually sell spatulas with removable heads (to make them dishwasher safe, I think). I bought one of those online, but when it arrived the head was a little too small for my tastes. (In the wilderness I always treat my hands as dirty. If I\'m licking the spatula, I want it to be big enough where I can hold it with my fingers near the top and lick near the bottom. I do not want to lick where my fingers are.)\n\nAbout a month after I had started to use the sawed-off spatula, I discovered that <a href="http://www.gsioutdoors.com">GSI</a> made exactly what I wanted: a <a href="http://www.gsioutdoors.com/activities/pdp/compact_scraper/gourmet_backpacking/">compact scraper</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4994406274/" title="GSI Compact Scraper by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/4994406274_63a0d3e91e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="GSI Compact Scraper" /></a>\n\nAt 16 grams (0.5 oz), it\'s not the lightest possible solution. But it\'s lighter than my first attempt, and the perfect size for my needs. The blue part is a soft rubber, like a normal spatula head. The white bit is hard plastic, meant for scraping burnt foods. (Burning your meal, I think, is a mistake you only make once. So far I\'ve not actually used the white part to scrape the pot. It\'s where I keep my fingers.)\n\nMy method of using the scraper differs slightly from Crow\'s. I eat the meal with my spork, attempting to get as much of the food as possible. Afterward, there will still be plenty left in the pot.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4994399004/" title="Pot After Oatmeal by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/4994399004_473c1719c1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pot After Oatmeal" /></a>\n\nWhen the spork is of no more use, I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4994401182/in/set-72157624840074361/">pour some water into the pot</a>, swish it around, and drink. (A habit I picked up in southern Idaho\'s desert. Water was scarce, so if you used it to clean your pot, you still had to drink it afterward. The taste is not always entirely pleasant, but you get used to it, and are wasting no resource.) This takes care of some of the left over food, but with meals like oatmeal, there\'s still gunk left over.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4993798487/" title="Pot After Water by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/4993798487_35b03df4ff_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pot After Water" /></a>\n\nAfter this precursory cleaning, I go to work with the scraper: scraping the pot clean, licking clean the spatula as I go (leave no calorie behind, I say). The pot will then be visibly clean.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4994409396/" title="Pot After Scraping by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/4994409396_98c7d9921a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pot After Scraping" /></a>\n\nAt this point, I may or may not boil water in the pot. If I have brought enough fuel for an after-meal drink, I\'ll boil the water in the pot to finish cleaning it, then dump the water into an old Vitamin Water bottle for a drink. Most of the time I don\'t plan on warm drinks. Either way, at the end of the process the pot will still have a little moisture in it. If I\'ve just had dinner, the cleaning is complete: I\'ll leave the pot till breakfast. On the other hand, if I\'m moving again after the meal, I don\'t like to pack my pot away wet, so I\'ll wipe it down with a small piece of an absorbent camp towel.\n\nThe GSI Compact Scraper is now a permanent part of my kitchen. Since I started using it at the end of last year, it\'s also the piece of gear that people request to borrow the most! (It goes in my mouth. I never lend it.)

If the wallet was half an inch or so wider, bills could be more easily slid inside.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4991639982/" title="Billfold by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/4991639982_fb6cb0c4bf_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Billfold" /></a></p>\n<p>I carry a few items in the wallet in addition to the normal cash, few cards, and ID.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4991632266/" title="Wallet Survival Items by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/4991632266_e05b5b2755_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Wallet Survival Items" /></a></p>\n<p>There is a small <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/06/07/possibles-pouch/#repair-kit">repair kit</a>, which consists of a #17 sailmaker&#8217;s needle, a #5 crewel needle, kevlar thread, a small safety pin, and a very small misch-metal ferro rod.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4991023335/" title="Wallet Repair Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/4991023335_d47d11d59f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Wallet Repair Kit" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to the repair kit are two AquaMira water purification tabs, two emergency $20 bills (to be used only if I&#8217;m lying half dead in a ditch), and a small piece of Rite-in-the-Rain paper with my <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a> <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/key.asc">key</a> fingerprint.

In the corner was his famous rucksack with cleaned-up pots and pants all fitting into one another in a compact unit and all tied and put away inside a knotted-up blue bandana... He had a slew of orange crates all filled with beautiful scholarly books, some of them in Oriental languages, all the great sutras, comments on sutras, the complete works of D.T.

    vellum_post_39.body = u'I\'ve had a few requests to do a gear list for some of my recent trips. Since it\'s been <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/04/01/gear-list/">over a year since the last one</a>, I thought I would acquiesce. What follows is the list from my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/08/28/the-goat-rocks-and-the-mountain-man/">recent journey to the Goat Rocks</a>. Though that was a short trip, my gear has varied very little on any trip this year. I\'ll take warmer clothing earlier (and later) in the year, and of course the amount of food varies based on the length of the trip, but most everything else remains static. This is quite the change from even just a year ago, where it seems like my gear would change drastically from trip to trip! Perhaps I know what I\'m doing a little better now.\n\nSome of the gear is light, some of it isn\'t. Regular readers know that I always struggle to find <a href="http://www.skillsforwildlives.com/2010/06/simplify-or-die/">a balance between lightweight, functionality, and durability</a>. Certain items that I carry -- like, say, the saw -- are not likely to be found in the pack of an average backpacker, but are suited to <a href="http://www.skillsforwildlives.com/2010/07/the-bushcraftlightweight-continuum/">my method of travel</a>. In all, my base weight for this trip was right at 20lbs. I\'m not too ashamed of that. In fact, considering that my pack alone weighs 6lbs when empty, that base weight is pretty darn good.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about the items, feel free to get in touch.\n\n<h2>Packed</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kifaru ZXR\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/15/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-dry-sacks/">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack</a> (13 liter)\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Kifaru 20F Slick Bag</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Coccoon Silk Mummy Liner</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li><a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/15/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-dry-sacks/">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack</a> (8 liter)\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Ex-Officio Boxer Briefs</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Fox River AXT Wick Dry Off Road Crew</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Ibex Woolies Bottoms</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Icebreaker L/S Inca</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Bandana (22" x 22", cotton)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Montbell U.L.

The result of volcanic explosions and glacial carving, the area is high and rugged; the way mountains are supposed to be.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935702633/" title="IMG_5916 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4935702633_1a879621d6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5916" /></a>\n\nMy entry into the area was via the Packwood Lake Trailhead. It\'s a popular trailhead, leading to the equally popular day-hiking destination of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Packwood_Lake">Packwood Lake</a>. The hike is about 4.5 miles to the lake along flat and well maintained trail.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935714679/" title="Packwood Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4935714679_73455283db_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Packwood Lake" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nAt over 1.5 miles long, the lake itself is fairly large. Near the head of the lake are three different structures: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936301796/in/set-72157624828322294/">a guard station</a> (guarding what from what, I wonder?), an old <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936309020/in/set-72157624828322294/">ranger station</a>, and, down the drainage a way, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936314666/in/set-72157624828322294/">a dam for generating electricity</a>. The lake itself is not in the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Goat_Rocks_Wilderness">wilderness</a> area, but surrounded by it.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935721701/" title="Packwood Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4935721701_9a4b3457ee_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Packwood Lake" /></a>\n\nI stopped at Packwood Lake to munch on a bit of trail mix, then donned my pack and began the climb along the northern ridge. My destination for the day was Lost Lake, another 3.5 miles from Packwood. It\'s a steep walk, gaining about 2,000 feet in 2 miles. Near the top the trail breaks out of the trees into a pleasant meadow.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936321326/" title="Lunch Stop by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4936321326_2253ce4a33_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Lunch Stop" /></a>\n\nI hadn\'t eaten much yet during the day, so I stopped in the meadow for a late lunch.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935732947/" title="In the Goat Rocks by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4935732947_dfcd6ac398_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="In the Goat Rocks" /></a>\n\nI arrived at Lost Lake near 7 PM. There was one small group with horses near the eastern end of the lake. At the northwest shore I found a nice and secluded spot. I could still hear the horses whinnying occasionally, so I figured that they would act as my bear detection system for the night.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935742665/" title="Camp at Lost Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4935742665_0995d50597_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Camp at Lost Lake" /></a>\n\nAfter pitching the tarp I gathered a bit of wood for the fire, cooked dinner, and settled in to watch the sunset.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936337570/" title="Evening at Lost Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4936337570_6c8093a321_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Evening at Lost Lake" /></a>\n\nIt was a full moon and another clear night. My headlamp wasn\'t necessary to find the bushes when I got up around 2 AM to make water. Before going back to bed, I wandered around a bit, playing in the moon shadows and watching the reflections on the lake.\n\nThere was no rush the following morning. I took my time enjoying the oats and watching the sunrise. When I decided to go, it took only a few minutes to break camp.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935750229/" title="Sunrise at Lost Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4935750229_31aa0a1ca4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sunrise at Lost Lake" /></a>\n\nThe plan for the day was to walk along Coyote Ridge to Packwood Saddle, then up to Elk Pass where I would get onto the PCT and head south aways. The trail along Coyote Ridge went through trees, and sometimes across steep, narrow and rocky ridges. Good mountain trail.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936355224/" title="Good Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4936355224_58416b3c59_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Good Trail" /></a>\n\nIt occasionally offered views to the north, south and west.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935755441/" title="Rainier from Coyote Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4935755441_88eee964f5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Rainier from Coyote Ridge" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935761485/" title="Toward Egg Bute, Old Snowy Mountain, and Johnson Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4935761485_e5009c36ed_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Toward Egg Bute, Old Snowy Mountain, and Johnson Peak" /></a>\n\nThe day had dawned clear, but clouds were slowly rolling in. By the time I got to the exposed ridge at the southern end of Coyote Ridge, the sky had filled up and strong winds were blowing in from the west. I\'d debated packing it beforehand, but now I was glad to have a wind shirt with me.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935770947/" title="Portrait at Coyote Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4935770947_5e2ec776f0_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Portrait at Coyote Ridge" /></a>\n\nFrom this part of the trail I could look further south to Egg Butte, Old Snowy Mountain, and Johnson Peak. This is where the trail would lead me after climbing up to Elk Pass. But the tops were all in clouds. I could tell there would be no visibility up there. Near Old Snowy Mountain I would have to traverse the tops of two glaciers, and the trail often went along steep ledges. I would have preferred the ability to see where I was going.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936359774/" title="Coyote Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4936359774_dc4af0fd24_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Coyote Ridge" /></a>\n\nAt Packwood Saddle I stopped for a lunch break and to ponder the situation. I waited for near an hour, but the clouds were only getting thicker. The decision was made that it wouldn\'t be safe for me to continue to get higher. Instead, I would cut over to the Upper Lake Creek Trail and head back down to Packwood Lake.\n\nFrom the saddle the trail descends steeply along a forested ridge before reaching the Upper Lake Creek at the bottom. The creek itself is a small, meandering affair that drains glaciers in the high country. I can\'t imagine that it ever gets enough water to fill the entire gravel bar -- if it did, it would be quite the torrent. I think it\'s more likely that the wide area was caused largely by avalanches.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935777109/" title="Gravel Bar and Meandering Creek by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4935777109_8778cd688c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Gravel Bar and Meandering Creek" /></a>\n\nThe trail washed out about halfway down the creek, forcing me to balance over a few thin, slippery logs to the gravel on the other side of the water. From the gravel I turned around to look back up the drainage. The clouds had indeed come in lower and thicker. I could no longer see even the saddle I had descended from an hour earlier.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936369622/" title="Johnson Peak Hidden By Clouds by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4936369622_befca92745_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Johnson Peak Hidden By Clouds" /></a>\n\nIt was near 5 PM when I arrived at the southeast head of Packwood Lake. There was a spot along the shore that looked like a good camp, so I dropped my pack and gathered wood for a fire.\n\nThe wind had followed me down. It blew strong gusts across the water, causing white caps and blowing my fire all over the place. I kept it small and low so as to not start any unwanted blazes. Once or twice the sun peaked out, but clouds dominated the sky.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936385244/" title="Storm at Packwood Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4936385244_39ce5bf310_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Storm at Packwood Lake" /></a>\n\nSitting around in the wind for a few hours takes a mental toll. I was glad to retreat to the shelter of the tarp just after the sun went down. When pitched properly, I sometimes think it would take a hurricane to blow that thing away.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936381086/" title="Camp at Packwood Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4936381086_88282ec1da_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Camp at Packwood Lake" /></a>\n\nThe wind blew the rest of the night, but didn\'t bother me. I was woken once before dawn by an owl who saw fit to hoot away in a tree above my camp.\n\nThe wind abated in the morning. The clouds remained. I breakfasted, began to pack, then thought better of it and instead warmed up water for hot chocolate. Finally I broke camp and got back on the trail at 10:30 AM.\n\nI had thought there was no one else at the lake, but as I walked along the shore I spotted a tarp pitched on a point along the northeastern edge. For some reason, tarp campers seem rare in these mountains, so I thought to stop by and congratulate the owner on not having a tent.\n\nThe occupant was one solitary man, cooking chili over the fire in a blackened old pot. We exchanged greetings and the necessary remarks about where we had been and where we were going. It turns out he had been out for a bit.\n\nHe was an older guy, in his early fifties. He\'d spent a few years in the Marines, and camped at a state park now and again ("that\'s not real camping," he admitted), but had never been in real wilderness or backpacked before. In June he decided to load up a rucksack and head out into the desert around Yakima for a week long trip. That was too hot, so he walked into the mountains. He\'s now finishing up his third month.\n\nWe chatted, about wilderness, long term mountain living, and the silly world below. Over the course of the summer he\'s been all over the Cascades in the southern half of the state. His routine was to walk into a town, quickly load up on as much food as he could carry, and then retreat back into the mountains. He doesn\'t like to spend more than a couple nights in the same spot, and never likes to walk the same trail twice. Since he had no experience backpacking before this summer, all of his gear was spartan -- things found at campsites, military surplus, and a few items from general camping stores. He didn\'t like to carry anything that ran out or could become dead weight: no stove, because he didn\'t want to mess with fuel. Other than the clothes on his back, he had one tarp to sleep under, one to sleep on, an old sleeping bag, some rain gear, one pot, one pan, a grill, knife, a pocket fishing kit (he wished he had a pole), a pair of sandals, ripped out pages of the DeLorme Atlas for Washington, a couple Klean Kanteens and a scavenged plastic water bottle. (He used to have a cell phone, but lost that when he fell into a river near the beginning of his trip. Figured the battery was almost dead anyway. It was just useless weight.) His gear took up less than a quarter of the volume of his large pack, leaving the rest to store food in.\n\nWhen I first asked him how much longer he thought he might stay out, he said another month or so. But after we talked for a while, he looked at me, smiled, and said "Actually, I was thinking of trying to spend a year." He\'d had enough close encounters with deer and elk that he figured with a rifle he could easily take care of the food problem. I showed him on his maps where I knew there were old cabins that could serve as a shelter. The <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/30/a-tale-of-two-in-the-wild-sky/">cabin at Eagle Lake</a>, with its wood stove, appealed to him.\n\nWe talked for a few hours. I think he was glad to find an eager listener. Most of the hikers he ran into thought he was crazy and wouldn\'t stick around him. He\'d been on the PCT some, but couldn\'t talk to thru-hikers because they wouldn\'t slow down and "didn\'t carry nothing." Resupplying every 5 days wasn\'t his style. He liked to get a couple weeks worth of food in his pack and wander aimlessly. If he found a good view, he\'d stop and sit for a while. <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/08/17/life-is-rambling/">He wasn\'t walking to get anywhere</a>.\n\n<blockquote>"Summers didn\'t guess his heart was as troubled as some. There wasn\'t any bur under his tail. He was a mountain man, or he had been, and traveled with hunters who never gave thought to soil and timber and tricks to pile up money but went along day by day taking what came, each morning being good in itself, and tomorrow was time enough to think about tomorrow. That was how Summers felt yet, but the movers were different. They traveled to get some place, as they lived life. Chances were they couldn\'t enjoy a woman and a bed for thinking what they had to do next... They were family men, settled with their women and easy with their children, the hard edges worn smooth, the wildness in them broke to harness. They looked ahead to farms and schools and government, to an ordered round of living."\n\n- <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/A._B._Guthrie,_Jr.">A.B. Guthrie, Jr.</a>, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Way_West">The Way West</a></blockquote>\n\nI recommended a few authors that I thought would be up his alley (Abbey and Proenneke, especially). He had been trying to learn a few wild plants that could be useful foods and medicines. I pointed out a couple more to him.\n\nIt was near 2:30 PM when I left him. His plan is to head north and check out the country up this way, so we\'ll probably run into each other again.\n\nAs for myself, I had another 5 miles back to the trailhead and the world below.'

My destination for the day was Lost Lake, another 3.5 miles from Packwood. It&#8217;s a steep walk, gaining about 2,000 feet in 2 miles. Near the top the trail breaks out of the trees into a pleasant meadow.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936321326/" title="Lunch Stop by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4936321326_2253ce4a33_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Lunch Stop" /></a></p>\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t eaten much yet during the day, so I stopped in the meadow for a late lunch.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935732947/" title="In the Goat Rocks by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4935732947_dfcd6ac398_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="In the Goat Rocks" /></a></p>\n<p>I arrived at Lost Lake near 7 PM. There was one small group with horses near the eastern end of the lake. At the northwest shore I found a nice and secluded spot. I could still hear the horses whinnying occasionally, so I figured that they would act as my bear detection system for the night.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935742665/" title="Camp at Lost Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4935742665_0995d50597_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Camp at Lost Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>After pitching the tarp I gathered a bit of wood for the fire, cooked dinner, and settled in to watch the sunset.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936337570/" title="Evening at Lost Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4936337570_6c8093a321_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Evening at Lost Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>It was a full moon and another clear night. My headlamp wasn&#8217;t necessary to find the bushes when I got up around 2 AM to make water. Before going back to bed, I wandered around a bit, playing in the moon shadows and watching the reflections on the lake.</p>\n<p>There was no rush the following morning. I took my time enjoying the oats and watching the sunrise. When I decided to go, it took only a few minutes to break camp.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935750229/" title="Sunrise at Lost Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4935750229_31aa0a1ca4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sunrise at Lost Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>The plan for the day was to walk along Coyote Ridge to Packwood Saddle, then up to Elk Pass where I would get onto the PCT and head south aways. The trail along Coyote Ridge went through trees, and sometimes across steep, narrow and rocky ridges. Good mountain trail.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936355224/" title="Good Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4936355224_58416b3c59_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Good Trail" /></a></p>\n<p>It occasionally offered views to the north, south and west.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935755441/" title="Rainier from Coyote Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4935755441_88eee964f5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Rainier from Coyote Ridge" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935761485/" title="Toward Egg Bute, Old Snowy Mountain, and Johnson Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4935761485_e5009c36ed_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Toward Egg Bute, Old Snowy Mountain, and Johnson Peak" /></a></p>\n<p>The day had dawned clear, but clouds were slowly rolling in. By the time I got to the exposed ridge at the southern end of Coyote Ridge, the sky had filled up and strong winds were blowing in from the west. I&#8217;d debated packing it beforehand, but now I was glad to have a wind shirt with me.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935770947/" title="Portrait at Coyote Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4935770947_5e2ec776f0_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Portrait at Coyote Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>From this part of the trail I could look further south to Egg Butte, Old Snowy Mountain, and Johnson Peak. This is where the trail would lead me after climbing up to Elk Pass. But the tops were all in clouds. I could tell there would be no visibility up there. Near Old Snowy Mountain I would have to traverse the tops of two glaciers, and the trail often went along steep ledges. I would have preferred the ability to see where I was going.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936359774/" title="Coyote Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4936359774_dc4af0fd24_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Coyote Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>At Packwood Saddle I stopped for a lunch break and to ponder the situation. I waited for near an hour, but the clouds were only getting thicker. The decision was made that it wouldn&#8217;t be safe for me to continue to get higher. Instead, I would cut over to the Upper Lake Creek Trail and head back down to Packwood Lake.</p>\n<p>From the saddle the trail descends steeply along a forested ridge before reaching the Upper Lake Creek at the bottom. The creek itself is a small, meandering affair that drains glaciers in the high country. I can&#8217;t imagine that it ever gets enough water to fill the entire gravel bar &#8212; if it did, it would be quite the torrent. I think it&#8217;s more likely that the wide area was caused largely by avalanches.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4935777109/" title="Gravel Bar and Meandering Creek by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4935777109_8778cd688c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Gravel Bar and Meandering Creek" /></a></p>\n<p>The trail washed out about halfway down the creek, forcing me to balance over a few thin, slippery logs to the gravel on the other side of the water. From the gravel I turned around to look back up the drainage. The clouds had indeed come in lower and thicker. I could no longer see even the saddle I had descended from an hour earlier.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936369622/" title="Johnson Peak Hidden By Clouds by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4936369622_befca92745_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Johnson Peak Hidden By Clouds" /></a></p>\n<p>It was near 5 PM when I arrived at the southeast head of Packwood Lake. There was a spot along the shore that looked like a good camp, so I dropped my pack and gathered wood for a fire.</p>\n<p>The wind had followed me down. It blew strong gusts across the water, causing white caps and blowing my fire all over the place. I kept it small and low so as to not start any unwanted blazes. Once or twice the sun peaked out, but clouds dominated the sky.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936385244/" title="Storm at Packwood Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4936385244_39ce5bf310_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Storm at Packwood Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>Sitting around in the wind for a few hours takes a mental toll. I was glad to retreat to the shelter of the tarp just after the sun went down. When pitched properly, I sometimes think it would take a hurricane to blow that thing away.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4936381086/" title="Camp at Packwood Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4936381086_88282ec1da_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Camp at Packwood Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>The wind blew the rest of the night, but didn&#8217;t bother me. I was woken once before dawn by an owl who saw fit to hoot away in a tree above my camp.</p>\n<p>The wind abated in the morning. The clouds remained. I breakfasted, began to pack, then thought better of it and instead warmed up water for hot chocolate. Finally I broke camp and got back on the trail at 10:30 AM.</p>\n<p>I had thought there was no one else at the lake, but as I walked along the shore I spotted a tarp pitched on a point along the northeastern edge. For some reason, tarp campers seem rare in these mountains, so I thought to stop by and congratulate the owner on not having a tent.</p>\n<p>The occupant was one solitary man, cooking chili over the fire in a blackened old pot. We exchanged greetings and the necessary remarks about where we had been and where we were going. It turns out he had been out for a bit.</p>\n<p>He was an older guy, in his early fifties. He&#8217;d spent a few years in the Marines, and camped at a state park now and again (&#8220;that&#8217;s not real camping,&#8221; he admitted), but had never been in real wilderness or backpacked before. In June he decided to load up a rucksack and head out into the desert around Yakima for a week long trip. That was too hot, so he walked into the mountains. He&#8217;s now finishing up his third month.</p>\n<p>We chatted, about wilderness, long term mountain living, and the silly world below. Over the course of the summer he&#8217;s been all over the Cascades in the southern half of the state. His routine was to walk into a town, quickly load up on as much food as he could carry, and then retreat back into the mountains. He doesn&#8217;t like to spend more than a couple nights in the same spot, and never likes to walk the same trail twice. Since he had no experience backpacking before this summer, all of his gear was spartan &#8212; things found at campsites, military surplus, and a few items from general camping stores. He didn&#8217;t like to carry anything that ran out or could become dead weight: no stove, because he didn&#8217;t want to mess with fuel. Other than the clothes on his back, he had one tarp to sleep under, one to sleep on, an old sleeping bag, some rain gear, one pot, one pan, a grill, knife, a pocket fishing kit (he wished he had a pole), a pair of sandals, ripped out pages of the DeLorme Atlas for Washington, a couple Klean Kanteens and a scavenged plastic water bottle. (He used to have a cell phone, but lost that when he fell into a river near the beginning of his trip. Figured the battery was almost dead anyway. It was just useless weight.) His gear took up less than a quarter of the volume of his large pack, leaving the rest to store food in.</p>\n<p>When I first asked him how much longer he thought he might stay out, he said another month or so. But after we talked for a while, he looked at me, smiled, and said &#8220;Actually, I was thinking of trying to spend a year.&#8221; He&#8217;d had enough close encounters with deer and elk that he figured with a rifle he could easily take care of the food problem. I showed him on his maps where I knew there were old cabins that could serve as a shelter. The <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/30/a-tale-of-two-in-the-wild-sky/">cabin at Eagle Lake</a>, with its wood stove, appealed to him.</p>\n<p>We talked for a few hours. I think he was glad to find an eager listener. Most of the hikers he ran into thought he was crazy and wouldn&#8217;t stick around him. He&#8217;d been on the PCT some, but couldn&#8217;t talk to thru-hikers because they wouldn&#8217;t slow down and &#8220;didn&#8217;t carry nothing.&#8221; Resupplying every 5 days wasn&#8217;t his style. He liked to get a couple weeks worth of food in his pack and wander aimlessly. If he found a good view, he&#8217;d stop and sit for a while. <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/08/17/life-is-rambling/">He wasn&#8217;t walking to get anywhere</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>&#8220;Summers didn&#8217;t guess his heart was as troubled as some. There wasn&#8217;t any bur under his tail. He was a mountain man, or he had been, and traveled with hunters who never gave thought to soil and timber and tricks to pile up money but went along day by day taking what came, each morning being good in itself, and tomorrow was time enough to think about tomorrow. That was how Summers felt yet, but the movers were different. They traveled to get some place, as they lived life. Chances were they couldn&#8217;t enjoy a woman and a bed for thinking what they had to do next&#8230; They were family men, settled with their women and easy with their children, the hard edges worn smooth, the wildness in them broke to harness. They looked ahead to farms and schools and government, to an ordered round of living.&#8221;\n\n- <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/A._B._Guthrie,_Jr.">A.B. Guthrie, Jr.</a>, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Way_West">The Way West</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>I recommended a few authors that I thought would be up his alley (Abbey and Proenneke, especially). He had been trying to learn a few wild plants that could be useful foods and medicines. I pointed out a couple more to him.</p>\n<p>It was near 2:30 PM when I left him. His plan is to head north and check out the country up this way, so we&#8217;ll probably run into each other again.</p>\n<p>As for myself, I had another 5 miles back to the trailhead and the world below.</p>'

The maps suggested a few possibilities, but one didn\'t commend itself to me over the others. I thought to contact Avagdu, who was still in Washington, to see if he had time for another walk before returning to California. He did, so I gave him the options I had come up with and asked what he would prefer.\n\nWe settled on heading into the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wild_Sky_Wilderness">Wild Sky Wilderness</a>. I would lead him <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/09/25/wild-sky/">back to Eagle Lake</a>, where we would spend the first night. The next day we would climb the ridge of Townsend Mountain, descend down the opposite side, and make our way to Sunset Lake for our second night. From there, we would hike out on the third day.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844195800/" title="Avagdu Prepares to Filter Water by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/4844195800_b8a2e142a4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Prepares to Filter Water" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhen we arrived at the trailhead in the early afternoon it was hot -- somewhere in the upper 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Too hot for hauling around a pack, but luckily the short, flat hike to the first destination of Barclay Lake was mostly in the shade. From there we would head up, and I hoped the higher elevations would be cooler.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843582259/" title="Mount Baring by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4843582259_c3c73bdd85.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mount Baring" /></a>\n\nI\'ve traveled to Eagle Lake via Barclay Lake a half dozen or so times, but the sight of the steep north face of Mount Baring jutting up from the lake basin never fails to impress. On the drive over I had told Avagdu that only yesterday <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012459596_base28m.html">a base-jumper had died leaping off Baring when her parachute failed to open</a>. The death is tragic, but still, I felt, like Ed, the need to congratulate her taste.\n\n<blockquote>Looking out on this panorama of light, space, rock and silence I am inclined to congratulate the dead man on his choice of jumping-off place; he had good taste. He had good luck -- I envy him the manner of his going: to die alone, on rock under sun at the brink of the unknown, like a wolf, like a great bird, seems to me very good fortune indeed. To die in the open, under the sky, far from the insolent interference of leech and priest, before this desert vastness opening like a window onto the eternity -- that surely was an overwhelming stroke of rare good luck.\n\n- <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Edward_Abbey">Edward Abbey</a>, Desert Solitaire</blockquote>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843588925/" title="Trail Marker by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/4843588925_15c3607649.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Trail Marker" /></a>\n\nAt Barclay Lake, the official trail ends. We turned north and headed up the steep slope to Stone Lake, which sits in a small saddle at the top of the ridge. The first half of the route is through forest. It\'s a popular route, so a trail made by the many feet of travelers is vaguely visible. The way is also marked by occasional flagging, which I always have a difficult time spotting on the way up. (On the way down, sticking to the route is easy.)\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843602381/" title="Avagdu Records the Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/4843602381_849988a7e5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Records the Trail" /></a>\n\nAfter breaking out of the trees we entered the boulder field. Here the route is marked by cairns, but at this point the way is obvious enough that the markers aren\'t really needed -- at least, the way is obvious enough to me after having ascended and descended the field a few times before!\n\nAt Stone Lake we stopped for a breather. We had gained enough elevation that the temperature was no longer uncomfortably hot, but still pleasant. While waiting for Avagdu to reach the lake, I ate an apple that I had been carrying.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843605049/" title="Paradise Meadow and Merchant Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/4843605049_ce441fc6a9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Paradise Meadow and Merchant Peak" /></a>\n\nFrom Stone Lake it was only a short 15 minute walk through Paradise Meadow to our day\'s destination of Eagle Lake. I warned Avagdu that the meadow would be extremely muddy, but in fact it was surprisingly dry. I had been in the area earlier in the year and later in the year, but never had I visited in late July, so clearly my predictions were off.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844231836/" title="Avagdu Contemplates How to Stay Dry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4844231836_60f7a55c54.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Contemplates How to Stay Dry" /></a>\n\nI enjoyed the pleasant walk through green grass, trying to avoid the occasional mud patch, and jumping over the creek as it meandered through the meadow. We spotted a few frogs jumping around, and one or two small trout in the creek.\n\nAs we approached Eagle Lake I saw a tent in the clearing on the edge of the lake at the south side of the creek. There was no one there, so we ventured over to the cabin to see if anyone was about. At the cabin was a family of three fishing the lake. They had spent the previous night at the lake and were planning on one more at the same site before heading out in the morrow. There had been no luck fishing, which surprised me as you usually can barely throw a rock into the lake without hitting a trout. We talked about Townsend and what lay on the other side before I suggested Avagdu take a look inside the cabin.\n\nIt\'s a neat place. I don\'t enjoy spending the night inside: it\'s small and dark and smelly and the mice always want to share the bed -- much better to spend the night under the stars -- but I enjoy visiting. The cabin looked to be in good repair and was cleaner than the last time I visited (in early February of this year). One new addition that caught my eye was a small inner tube tucked away in the corner. I had visions of floating about the lake, followed by visions of being extremely cold. But the latter was not enough to deter me. I knew that I could not echo <a href="https://twitter.com/SHAQ/statuses/1405672066">the timeless lament of Shaquille O\'Neal</a> (particularly since I had used that quote as my email signature for the better part of a year and even had the piece of zen wisdom inscribed on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3868768303/">a bright yellow pin</a>).\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843618119/" title="First Night Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4843618119_497cd78fd6.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="First Night Camp" /></a>\n\nWe left the cabin to go make camp. My preferred site was on the opposite side of the creek that drains the lake. There was one clear, flat spot that I usually used for my tarp, but no other spot that was ideal for Avagdu. Since I intended to pitch the tarp in an elevated manner, we decided that there would be plenty of room for both of us to sleep below it. The chance of rain that night was slight, anyways.\n\nHaving made camp and filled up on water, I returned to the cabin to grab the inner tube. It was about 5 PM. I figured that I had enough time to kick around the lake for a bit and then dry off before the sun was lost behind Merchant Peak.\n\nThe tube, it turned out, was a little small. It floated, but after putting my weight on it, it sunk in about halfway. With my butt hanging down the middle, I was submerged up to my navel. Still, the water was actually pleasant after getting over the initial shock -- much warmer than some of the icy cold rivers and alpine lakes I\'ve jumped into in the past. I kicked around for a bit and thought to use the opportunity to try out a small pocket fishing kit I had put together a few months ago, but I was unable to efficiently cast with it. After seeing that I hadn\'t died of shock from the water, Avagdu decided to join me. He slowly made his way in until the water was up to his neck. I suggested that, since my small kit had failed, he could swim down the shore to the cabin and pick up the spinning rod that was hung on one of the rafters. He had had the same thought.\n\nAs Avagdu swam, I slowly attempted to follow, but it was difficult to propel the tube in the direction I wanted to go. After he got the rod, Avagdu walked back down along some of the logs that cluttered the shore and we managed to meet about halfway. I had him hold out the tip of the rod to me as I tied on a rooster tail lure that I had spotted in the water near where I had gotten on the tube. "Okay, you\'re fishing!" I announced.\n\nWe figured out how the spin-cast reel worked and, after only a couple tips, Avagdu was casting out to the lake. I gave it a couple shots as well, but neither of us had any bites.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843628339/" title="Eagle Lake and Merchant Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/4843628339_6b0081604e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Eagle Lake and Merchant Peak" /></a>\n\nSoon the sun fell beneath the peak of Merchant. Though there were still many hours till dark, neither of us wished to be standing around wet without the direct warmth of the sun. We walked back to camp.\n\nI had gotten in the lake in my underwear and pants. Dry underwear and merino long johns awaited me in my pack, so I wasn\'t concerned about that. The pants were quick drying, but in the meantime I didn\'t want to put them on and wet out my dry underwear. So I was walking around camp in my long johns, which I was concerned about: being made of a lightweight merino wool, they are somewhat delicate. I didn\'t want to sit down directly on the ground or on a log without some other layer of protection, out of fear of snagging them. Before leaving for the trip I had taken my normal rain pants out of the pack to save weight, but had tossed in a garbage bag rain skirt on the off-chance that rain did occur. So, as a bit of protection until my pants dried, I donned the stylish garbage bag skirt.\n\nWe both wanted a fire to dry our things. Easy to gather wood was scarce in the area, but soon enough we had a merry blaze.\n\nAs the sun set the bugs came out in force. They bothered me a bit, but were bearable. Avagdu, however, they loved. He couldn\'t go more than a minute without waving his hands around and slapping himself. I had packed along a bottle of a natural insect repellent that I was skeptical of, but wished to test further. After trying it out, Avagdu concurred with my conclusion that the repellent worked great for ten or fifteen minutes, but then failed. Still, we had the smoke of the fire to protect us.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843621631/" title="Preparing to Leave by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4843621631_6a73417a7d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Preparing to Leave" /></a>\n\nThe following day we rose around 7 AM, breakfasted, and broke camp. Shouldering our packs, we headed for the ridge of Townsend Mountain that lay along the north side of the lake.\n\nThe first part of the route was through thick bush, but this quickly led to an easy climb up a small talus field. As with the previous day\'s walk, there was no official trail, but people did sometimes come this way and cairns occasionally suggested a route.\n\nAfter the talus it was back into the bush. I enjoy off-trail travel, but the trouble is that when making my own way, I have a tendency to always go straight up and make nary a switchback. A defect in my character, perhaps. No matter. Switchbacks are luxuries, not necessities.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843637915/" title="Merchant Peak from Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/4843637915_96701d26fe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Merchant Peak from Townsend" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843636423/" title="Looking East to Steven\'s Pass from Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/4843636423_e19f9d2186.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Looking East to Steven\'s Pass from Townsend" /></a>\n\nBreaking through the bush we entered an open area of rock. This was a little over halfway up the mountain. We stopped for a breather and to enjoy the view.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844257784/" title="Cairn on Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/4844257784_dda0676558.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cairn on Townsend" /></a>\n\nObserving the face of the mountain from below I had pointed out this large face of rock to Avagdu, saying "See that rock? We don\'t want to go up it, so we\'ll just hug the edge and make our way around. We\'ll come above it and then have only a short skip to the top." A good plan. But near the rock on which we sat I spotted a cairn, and another beyond it. This seemed to suggest that there was a safe route across the field. Okay, I said to myself. I had never been up here before, so thought to trust to the judgment of my predecessors on the mountain. We donned our packs, and I led Avagdu off in the direction of the markers.\n\nThe route started out easy, but progressively got steeper. I couldn\'t spot any more cairns, so I observed the rock and picked my own route. We moved from scrambling to what was basically rock climbing -- but with full packs, boots, and no ropes or other safety equipment. This was my idea of fun. I was quite enjoying myself. Avagdu was making his way, but struggling a bit and falling behind. As I was waiting on a small ledge for him, he called out that he would need some help. I stashed my pack in a crack and, after making sure that it was secure, went back down to him. It was his pack that was slowing him down, so I threw it on my back, climbed back up, and stashed it with my own. Then I guided him to the ledge where I waited.\n\nDirectly above us the way looked more technical. We would have had more difficulty climbing that with our packs. But off to one side I spotted another cairn on an angle of the slope. Studying the rock, I saw what would make a decent enough path for us to use to traverse over to the cairn. Due to the angle I couldn\'t see what lay on the other side, but I assumed that since there was a marker it would lead us back onto a more manageable route. I pointed out the cairn to Avagdu and the path that I meant to follow. He wisely queried how we would get from where we were to the ledge that started the path. I replied "I don\'t know. Just follow me." I was making this up as I went!\n\nGetting to the path wouldn\'t have been much trouble, but for the water. Most of the rock between it and where we were was wet from a trickle that came down from the top of the mountain (from snow melt I thought, since the map showed no other water source up there). It made the rock slick and extremely difficult to get any purchase on. I managed to traverse a few feet laterally from where Avagdu stood till I got myself jammed in a crack. I hoped to be able to make my way down the crack to where the path started below. But there was water in there as well and I couldn\'t get enough holds. About halfway down I decided that this wasn\'t going to work. There was a slope to the crack and I had been making my way down it facing out. With my pack on again, I couldn\'t turn around and face into the mountain to climb back up. I tried inching my way back up while still facing out, but that didn\'t work either: I had no holds for my feet and I couldn\'t spot where I should be placing my hands. There was no going anywhere with the pack on.\n\nI pushed out on either side of the crack with both my legs so that I could temporarily take my hands off the rock and slip out of my pack straps. Then I slowly moved my body forward and down to see if the pack was jammed in enough to stay where it was. I had to move only a couple inches before realizing that the pack was coming too. That wouldn\'t work. I yelled back up to where Avagdu was watching and asked if he had any paracord. He did, so I told him to throw me one end and keep the other. He got it out and untangled it as I thought to myself "Does he have to take forever with this?" I\'m sure it was only 15 seconds or so, but my feet had slipped, and I was holding up both my body and my pack with only my locked out arms.\n\nEventually he tossed the end to me and I was able to get enough purchase with my feet again to temporarily remove my hands and tie the cord in a quick knot around one of the shoulder straps of my pack. Having done this, I instructed Avagdu to slowly start to pull in the cord until it was taut. "Okay," I said. "You have my pack." I moved forward away from the pack, but found that even without the extra weight on my back, I wasn\'t going to be able to make it along this route to where the path started. I was able to get out of the crack and onto the rock face on the opposite side from Avagdu and scrambled back up till I was level with him. I asked him to hold onto the cord for a bit longer until I could figure out what to do, and then went scrambling around, trying to find a route. There wasn\'t much of promise. I scrambled up a little higher along a slick face till I couldn\'t go up anymore, and then found that I couldn\'t get back down. "Whoops," I thought to myself and announced out loud that I was stuck (which probably didn\'t do much good for Avagdu\'s morale). But I found that by laying down on the rock so that my whole body was in contact I was able to generate enough friction to slowly slide and inchworm my way back down to a more secure area.\n\nAvagdu suggested that we turn around. The way showed no signs of easing up and since I was having such difficulty I knew that Avagdu would probably not enjoy this next bit, even if he could do it. So I agreed. I was disappointed that we wouldn\'t make the top and see what was on the other side, but it was my fault for trying to go up along these rocks rather than trusting my original plan of hugging the edge and going around them.\n\nBut there was still that cairn that I had spotted over in the distance. The way we took up was certainly not the intended trail and would be no easier going down. If that cairn marked the trail, it would probably offer a better path back down to the lake. I stilled wanted to reach it.\n\nI thought to try the crack again. I made my way back down till I was above the pack and, making sure that Avagdu still had a good hold on the cord, gave it a slight kick till it swung out of the way. With the crack cleared, I eventually made it down to the path that I had been aiming for. I walked along it a ways toward the cairn, but I didn\'t like what I saw between us and it. And I didn\'t like what I couldn\'t see, on the other side of the angle. I decided to take the known challenge offered by the route that we had come up, rather than risk the unknown.\n\nBack at the bottom of the crack I had come down on, I found that I couldn\'t make it back up to where Avagdu sat. I spotted what looked like a doable route below me and announced to Avagdu that I would make my way down a bit, traverse to the other side, and then climb back up to where he was. He assented, though I\'m sure he was tired of holding up my pack by a single piece of paracord at this point. He probably was thinking that I would fall off and die and there would be no one to get him off the mountain.\n\n<blockquote>I have thought briefly about getting caught in rock slides or falling from a rock face. If that happened, I would probably perish on the mountain in much the same way many of the big animals do. I would be long gone before anyone found me. My only wish would be that folks wouldn\'t spend a lot of time searching. When the time comes for man to look his Maker in the eye, where better could the meeting be held than in the wilderness?\n\n- <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Richard_Proenneke">Richard Proenneke</a>, One Man\'s Wilderness</blockquote>\n\nGetting down and over was easy. The way back up proved more challenging. There were handholds, but with my boots on, I couldn\'t get my toes into anyplace where they needed to be. So I basically pulled myself back up the mountain with just my arms.\n\nI had almost reached Avagdu, but then found that, on this side, I could actually get to where my pack was hanging and take that off his hands. So I headed over there, got a hold on it, and had him drop the cord. Then I traversed off in the other direction a bit till I found a spot where I could securely stash the pack. I untied the paracord from it, wrapped it around my hand, and went back to the spot where the pack had previously been dangling, right below Avagdu. Tossing one end of the cord back up, I instructed him to tie it onto his pack. He did so, and I said that he should then slowly lower the pack down to where I was. I would hold onto the end of the cord and he would lower from above, acting as a sort of pulley in the three-point system. He lowered it down till I could grab it. I put it on my back and had him drop the cord, then traversed back over to my pack and stashed his next to it.\n\nAvagdu came over till he was directly above me and I guided him down to where I was. He wasn\'t comfortable moving down the mountain with his pack on, so I donned my own and climbed down 30 feet or so till I found another spot where I could take it off and stash it. Then I had him slowly lower his own pack to me via the paracord. When I could grab it, he would drop the cord and I would stash his pack with mine and wait for him to make his way down.\n\nWe repeated this procedure a couple times till the slope of the rock eased up again and the going was simpler. I figured he could make it down easily enough with the pack on. I made my own way down to a sort of mini-cirque where I could stand comfortably and wait for him.\n\nAvagdu made his way down, dragging his pack along side him. Above where I was standing he announced that he was going to drop his pack. I assumed he meant that he would hold on to one end of the cord that was still tied to the pack. I got out of the way and saw him toss down the pack without holding onto the cord. Turning around, I watched the pack tumble off the cliff behind me and vanish from sight.\n\nLuckily Avagdu could watch it fall down the mountain from his higher vantage point. He saw it land in a finger of greenery that shot up into the rocks from the treeline below. It was a bit off from the path that I had intended to follow back down.\n\nWe went down a ways before I dropped my pack and said that I would go down into the bushes and retrieve his. I knew he was physically tired at this point and the fact that he had just thrown his pack off a mountain suggested that he was somewhat mentally exhausted. I didn\'t think he needed to climb down, beat around the bushes for a bit, and then climb back up till where we could continue our planned descent.\n\nThe bushes were thick. I poked around a bit and, not finding anything, climbed back up till where I could see Avagdu. I yelled up to him, asking exactly where he saw the pack come in. He replied that he couldn\'t be sure from the spot where he was. I silently thought to myself "Well you need to be fucking sure! I can\'t scour this whole mountain for the pack that you threw off it." But rather than voicing my thoughts, I turned around and dived into another spot in the bushes and small trees. Pushing my way through, I stumbled upon the pack. I looked it over briefly and nothing appeared to be broken, so I threw it on my back and began the hard climb back up to where Avagdu waited. "Don\'t do that again," I suggested as I returned his pack.\n\nI knew that my internal frustration toward Avagdu was unjustified. I was supposed to be the experienced one who was leading this little venture. I could only blame myself for anything that occurred. It pointed at my own mental exhaustion. We both needed to sit down, hydrate, and eat something. In the distance below us I could spot the rock that we rested on as soon as we had broken out of the tree line on the way up. I took off for that.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843644105/" title="Avagdu Descends Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/4843644105_8e179477b7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Descends Townsend" /></a>\n\nFrom there it was only an hour\'s easy climb back down to the lake, so I didn\'t have any problem draining my last liter of water. After drinking, I threw down a Clif Bar. Feeling much better after that, I yelled out a bit of guidance to Avagdu, who was a little ways behind me but doing a good job of making his way down. As he approached, he teased me, saying my problem was that I confused backpacking with mountaineering. I smiled, but replied honestly that in my book they were the same thing. I couldn\'t spot a difference. Later, I reminded him that before heading out I had told him that this would be an easy, mellow trip. "I\'m a man of my word," I said.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844265364/" title="Avagdu Descends Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4844265364_568d6231ac.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Descends Townsend" /></a>\n\nAfter Avagdu had drank and eaten something, I led the way back down. I broke off from the marked route after a few hundred feet, favoring what looked like a more direct path. It went through a bit thicker bush, but I still think it ended up being a quicker descent.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844268992/" title="Second Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/4844268992_c9f80627a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Second Camp" /></a>\n\nSince the family of three had gone, we decided to make camp in the larger clearing opposite the creek from where we had camped the previous night. I quickly threw up my tarp, filled up my water containers, gathered some firewood, and cooked an early dinner while Avagdu was still pitching his own tarp. It was about 5 PM. We were both glad to be back at the lake, and I had my mind set on that inner tube and fishing rod again. After Avagdu pitched his tarp, he helped to gather a bit more wood before filtering water for himself. I had finished my rice before he started to cook his own meal, but I waited around for a bit to get a little digestion happening before getting into the lake.\n\nWhen I jumped on the tube, the cold water was invigorating and refreshing. I kicked around the lake a little bit while Avagdu ate his meal. Eventually I tired of that and thought I would see what I could do about getting some line wet.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843664275/" title="Reflection and Driftwood in Eagle Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/4843664275_f70ff587e6.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Reflection and Driftwood in Eagle Lake" /></a>\n\nOn the second or third cast I noticed a small trout investigating my scavenged lure, but he wouldn\'t bite. I tried to get the next cast in that general area and, by luck, succeeded. As soon as it hit, I felt the bite and started to reel it in. But the line snapped and the little guy made off with my hook. I have no idea what type of line was in the reel or what its age or condition was, but it also might have been the fault of my knot. I tried casting a few more times with a couple of the different hooks and lures that I had in my pocket kit, but had no luck. All the fish were jumping for the bugs on top of the water, but none but the one who had taken my lure seemed interested in anything under the surface. A fly rod would probably have been the weapon of choice.\n\nAvagdu and I hung out on the logs on the shore of the lake until the sun dipped below Merchant Peak once more. As the sun left, the mosquitoes appeared. We decided to return to the camp and light up the fire to smoke all the bugs out.\n\nOn the way down the mountain, Avagdu had ripped out the stitching on one of the bottom compression straps on his pack. It was his first field repair, so I loaned him the kit from <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/24/the-humble-boonie-hat/">my hat</a> to sew it up. I advised an X-ed box stitch. After preparing my second dinner, I looked back to his sewing and saw his creative interpretation of a box stitch. We both laughed as I pointed out what I had meant by a box stitch. His stitching looked plenty strong for the job, so it didn\'t much matter. Embolden by his sewing success, Avagdu decided to use the Reflectix material I had given him to make his first pot cozy.\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent talking around the fire. There had been a few thick logs stacked next to the fire ring. After our fire had got good and hot I was able to arrange three of the thick logs into a tripod and had them burning strongly in a manner that probably would have heated us all night, had we wanted it. Around 11 PM we retired to our bags for sleep.\n\nI awoke once at 2 AM to get up and pee. The fire was still burning brightly.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844287062/" title="Smoke in the Trees by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/4844287062_844f885903.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Smoke in the Trees" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844300614/" title="Stone Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/4844300614_28e3cf3151.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Stone Lake" /></a>\n\nNext morning I slept in, awakening at 8 AM to find Avagdu already tending the fire and cooking breakfast. We had a slow morning, eating, talking, and packing. Late in the morning we left Eagle Lake and returned through Paradise Meadow to Stone Lake. Then, it was an easy hike back down to Barclay Lake.\n\nIt was the hottest day of the trip. When we reached Barclay Lake I took off my shirt and jumped in (much to the the chagrin of some of the family day hikers who were there, I think). I swam for about a minute before getting out and eating a little beef jerky followed by granola while drying off. After Avagdu had eaten something we hit the trail again for the final stretch back to the trailhead.\n\nAvagdu had a bus to catch late that afternoon, so I set a 4 mph pace. We reached the trailhead in good time and, after refreshing ourselves, traded the safety of mountains for the hazards of urbanity.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843691347/" title="Leaving the Wilderness by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/4843691347_5b468f3e1a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Leaving the Wilderness" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>We are vagabonds of a peculiar type.

The maps suggested a few possibilities, but one didn&#8217;t commend itself to me over the others. I thought to contact Avagdu, who was still in Washington, to see if he had time for another walk before returning to California. He did, so I gave him the options I had come up with and asked what he would prefer.</p>\n<p>We settled on heading into the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wild_Sky_Wilderness">Wild Sky Wilderness</a>.

The death is tragic, but still, I felt, like Ed, the need to congratulate her taste.</p>\n<blockquote>Looking out on this panorama of light, space, rock and silence I am inclined to congratulate the dead man on his choice of jumping-off place; he had good taste.

We turned north and headed up the steep slope to Stone Lake, which sits in a small saddle at the top of the ridge. The first half of the route is through forest.

I warned Avagdu that the meadow would be extremely muddy, but in fact it was surprisingly dry. I had been in the area earlier in the year and later in the year, but never had I visited in late July, so clearly my predictions were off.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844231836/" title="Avagdu Contemplates How to Stay Dry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4844231836_60f7a55c54.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Contemplates How to Stay Dry" /></a></p>\n<p>I enjoyed the pleasant walk through green grass, trying to avoid the occasional mud patch, and jumping over the creek as it meandered through the meadow. We spotted a few frogs jumping around, and one or two small trout in the creek.</p>\n<p>As we approached Eagle Lake I saw a tent in the clearing on the edge of the lake at the south side of the creek. There was no one there, so we ventured over to the cabin to see if anyone was about. At the cabin was a family of three fishing the lake. They had spent the previous night at the lake and were planning on one more at the same site before heading out in the morrow. There had been no luck fishing, which surprised me as you usually can barely throw a rock into the lake without hitting a trout. We talked about Townsend and what lay on the other side before I suggested Avagdu take a look inside the cabin.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a neat place. I don&#8217;t enjoy spending the night inside: it&#8217;s small and dark and smelly and the mice always want to share the bed &#8212; much better to spend the night under the stars &#8212; but I enjoy visiting. The cabin looked to be in good repair and was cleaner than the last time I visited (in early February of this year). One new addition that caught my eye was a small inner tube tucked away in the corner. I had visions of floating about the lake, followed by visions of being extremely cold. But the latter was not enough to deter me. I knew that I could not echo <a href="https://twitter.com/SHAQ/statuses/1405672066">the timeless lament of Shaquille O&#8217;Neal</a> (particularly since I had used that quote as my email signature for the better part of a year and even had the piece of zen wisdom inscribed on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3868768303/">a bright yellow pin</a>).</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843618119/" title="First Night Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4843618119_497cd78fd6.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="First Night Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>We left the cabin to go make camp. My preferred site was on the opposite side of the creek that drains the lake. There was one clear, flat spot that I usually used for my tarp, but no other spot that was ideal for Avagdu. Since I intended to pitch the tarp in an elevated manner, we decided that there would be plenty of room for both of us to sleep below it. The chance of rain that night was slight, anyways.</p>\n<p>Having made camp and filled up on water, I returned to the cabin to grab the inner tube. It was about 5 PM. I figured that I had enough time to kick around the lake for a bit and then dry off before the sun was lost behind Merchant Peak.</p>\n<p>The tube, it turned out, was a little small. It floated, but after putting my weight on it, it sunk in about halfway. With my butt hanging down the middle, I was submerged up to my navel. Still, the water was actually pleasant after getting over the initial shock &#8212; much warmer than some of the icy cold rivers and alpine lakes I&#8217;ve jumped into in the past. I kicked around for a bit and thought to use the opportunity to try out a small pocket fishing kit I had put together a few months ago, but I was unable to efficiently cast with it. After seeing that I hadn&#8217;t died of shock from the water, Avagdu decided to join me. He slowly made his way in until the water was up to his neck. I suggested that, since my small kit had failed, he could swim down the shore to the cabin and pick up the spinning rod that was hung on one of the rafters. He had had the same thought.</p>\n<p>As Avagdu swam, I slowly attempted to follow, but it was difficult to propel the tube in the direction I wanted to go. After he got the rod, Avagdu walked back down along some of the logs that cluttered the shore and we managed to meet about halfway. I had him hold out the tip of the rod to me as I tied on a rooster tail lure that I had spotted in the water near where I had gotten on the tube. &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;re fishing!&#8221; I announced.</p>\n<p>We figured out how the spin-cast reel worked and, after only a couple tips, Avagdu was casting out to the lake. I gave it a couple shots as well, but neither of us had any bites.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843628339/" title="Eagle Lake and Merchant Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/4843628339_6b0081604e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Eagle Lake and Merchant Peak" /></a></p>\n<p>Soon the sun fell beneath the peak of Merchant. Though there were still many hours till dark, neither of us wished to be standing around wet without the direct warmth of the sun. We walked back to camp.</p>\n<p>I had gotten in the lake in my underwear and pants. Dry underwear and merino long johns awaited me in my pack, so I wasn&#8217;t concerned about that. The pants were quick drying, but in the meantime I didn&#8217;t want to put them on and wet out my dry underwear. So I was walking around camp in my long johns, which I was concerned about: being made of a lightweight merino wool, they are somewhat delicate. I didn&#8217;t want to sit down directly on the ground or on a log without some other layer of protection, out of fear of snagging them. Before leaving for the trip I had taken my normal rain pants out of the pack to save weight, but had tossed in a garbage bag rain skirt on the off-chance that rain did occur. So, as a bit of protection until my pants dried, I donned the stylish garbage bag skirt.</p>\n<p>We both wanted a fire to dry our things. Easy to gather wood was scarce in the area, but soon enough we had a merry blaze.</p>\n<p>As the sun set the bugs came out in force. They bothered me a bit, but were bearable. Avagdu, however, they loved. He couldn&#8217;t go more than a minute without waving his hands around and slapping himself. I had packed along a bottle of a natural insect repellent that I was skeptical of, but wished to test further. After trying it out, Avagdu concurred with my conclusion that the repellent worked great for ten or fifteen minutes, but then failed. Still, we had the smoke of the fire to protect us.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843621631/" title="Preparing to Leave by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/4843621631_6a73417a7d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Preparing to Leave" /></a></p>\n<p>The following day we rose around 7 AM, breakfasted, and broke camp. Shouldering our packs, we headed for the ridge of Townsend Mountain that lay along the north side of the lake.</p>\n<p>The first part of the route was through thick bush, but this quickly led to an easy climb up a small talus field. As with the previous day&#8217;s walk, there was no official trail, but people did sometimes come this way and cairns occasionally suggested a route.</p>\n<p>After the talus it was back into the bush. I enjoy off-trail travel, but the trouble is that when making my own way, I have a tendency to always go straight up and make nary a switchback. A defect in my character, perhaps. No matter. Switchbacks are luxuries, not necessities.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843637915/" title="Merchant Peak from Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/4843637915_96701d26fe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Merchant Peak from Townsend" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843636423/" title="Looking East to Steven\'s Pass from Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/4843636423_e19f9d2186.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Looking East to Steven\'s Pass from Townsend" /></a></p>\n<p>Breaking through the bush we entered an open area of rock. This was a little over halfway up the mountain. We stopped for a breather and to enjoy the view.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844257784/" title="Cairn on Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/4844257784_dda0676558.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cairn on Townsend" /></a></p>\n<p>Observing the face of the mountain from below I had pointed out this large face of rock to Avagdu, saying &#8220;See that rock? We don&#8217;t want to go up it, so we&#8217;ll just hug the edge and make our way around. We&#8217;ll come above it and then have only a short skip to the top.&#8221; A good plan. But near the rock on which we sat I spotted a cairn, and another beyond it. This seemed to suggest that there was a safe route across the field. Okay, I said to myself. I had never been up here before, so thought to trust to the judgment of my predecessors on the mountain. We donned our packs, and I led Avagdu off in the direction of the markers.</p>\n<p>The route started out easy, but progressively got steeper. I couldn&#8217;t spot any more cairns, so I observed the rock and picked my own route. We moved from scrambling to what was basically rock climbing &#8212; but with full packs, boots, and no ropes or other safety equipment. This was my idea of fun. I was quite enjoying myself. Avagdu was making his way, but struggling a bit and falling behind. As I was waiting on a small ledge for him, he called out that he would need some help. I stashed my pack in a crack and, after making sure that it was secure, went back down to him. It was his pack that was slowing him down, so I threw it on my back, climbed back up, and stashed it with my own. Then I guided him to the ledge where I waited.</p>\n<p>Directly above us the way looked more technical. We would have had more difficulty climbing that with our packs. But off to one side I spotted another cairn on an angle of the slope. Studying the rock, I saw what would make a decent enough path for us to use to traverse over to the cairn. Due to the angle I couldn&#8217;t see what lay on the other side, but I assumed that since there was a marker it would lead us back onto a more manageable route. I pointed out the cairn to Avagdu and the path that I meant to follow. He wisely queried how we would get from where we were to the ledge that started the path. I replied &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Just follow me.&#8221; I was making this up as I went!</p>\n<p>Getting to the path wouldn&#8217;t have been much trouble, but for the water. Most of the rock between it and where we were was wet from a trickle that came down from the top of the mountain (from snow melt I thought, since the map showed no other water source up there). It made the rock slick and extremely difficult to get any purchase on. I managed to traverse a few feet laterally from where Avagdu stood till I got myself jammed in a crack. I hoped to be able to make my way down the crack to where the path started below. But there was water in there as well and I couldn&#8217;t get enough holds. About halfway down I decided that this wasn&#8217;t going to work. There was a slope to the crack and I had been making my way down it facing out. With my pack on again, I couldn&#8217;t turn around and face into the mountain to climb back up. I tried inching my way back up while still facing out, but that didn&#8217;t work either: I had no holds for my feet and I couldn&#8217;t spot where I should be placing my hands. There was no going anywhere with the pack on.</p>\n<p>I pushed out on either side of the crack with both my legs so that I could temporarily take my hands off the rock and slip out of my pack straps. Then I slowly moved my body forward and down to see if the pack was jammed in enough to stay where it was. I had to move only a couple inches before realizing that the pack was coming too. That wouldn&#8217;t work. I yelled back up to where Avagdu was watching and asked if he had any paracord. He did, so I told him to throw me one end and keep the other. He got it out and untangled it as I thought to myself &#8220;Does he have to take forever with this?&#8221; I&#8217;m sure it was only 15 seconds or so, but my feet had slipped, and I was holding up both my body and my pack with only my locked out arms.</p>\n<p>Eventually he tossed the end to me and I was able to get enough purchase with my feet again to temporarily remove my hands and tie the cord in a quick knot around one of the shoulder straps of my pack. Having done this, I instructed Avagdu to slowly start to pull in the cord until it was taut. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You have my pack.&#8221; I moved forward away from the pack, but found that even without the extra weight on my back, I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to make it along this route to where the path started. I was able to get out of the crack and onto the rock face on the opposite side from Avagdu and scrambled back up till I was level with him. I asked him to hold onto the cord for a bit longer until I could figure out what to do, and then went scrambling around, trying to find a route. There wasn&#8217;t much of promise. I scrambled up a little higher along a slick face till I couldn&#8217;t go up anymore, and then found that I couldn&#8217;t get back down. &#8220;Whoops,&#8221; I thought to myself and announced out loud that I was stuck (which probably didn&#8217;t do much good for Avagdu&#8217;s morale). But I found that by laying down on the rock so that my whole body was in contact I was able to generate enough friction to slowly slide and inchworm my way back down to a more secure area.</p>\n<p>Avagdu suggested that we turn around. The way showed no signs of easing up and since I was having such difficulty I knew that Avagdu would probably not enjoy this next bit, even if he could do it. So I agreed. I was disappointed that we wouldn&#8217;t make the top and see what was on the other side, but it was my fault for trying to go up along these rocks rather than trusting my original plan of hugging the edge and going around them.</p>\n<p>But there was still that cairn that I had spotted over in the distance. The way we took up was certainly not the intended trail and would be no easier going down. If that cairn marked the trail, it would probably offer a better path back down to the lake. I stilled wanted to reach it.</p>\n<p>I thought to try the crack again. I made my way back down till I was above the pack and, making sure that Avagdu still had a good hold on the cord, gave it a slight kick till it swung out of the way. With the crack cleared, I eventually made it down to the path that I had been aiming for. I walked along it a ways toward the cairn, but I didn&#8217;t like what I saw between us and it. And I didn&#8217;t like what I couldn&#8217;t see, on the other side of the angle. I decided to take the known challenge offered by the route that we had come up, rather than risk the unknown.</p>\n<p>Back at the bottom of the crack I had come down on, I found that I couldn&#8217;t make it back up to where Avagdu sat. I spotted what looked like a doable route below me and announced to Avagdu that I would make my way down a bit, traverse to the other side, and then climb back up to where he was. He assented, though I&#8217;m sure he was tired of holding up my pack by a single piece of paracord at this point. He probably was thinking that I would fall off and die and there would be no one to get him off the mountain.</p>\n<blockquote>I have thought briefly about getting caught in rock slides or falling from a rock face. If that happened, I would probably perish on the mountain in much the same way many of the big animals do. I would be long gone before anyone found me. My only wish would be that folks wouldn&#8217;t spend a lot of time searching. When the time comes for man to look his Maker in the eye, where better could the meeting be held than in the wilderness?\n\n- <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Richard_Proenneke">Richard Proenneke</a>, One Man&#8217;s Wilderness</blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting down and over was easy. The way back up proved more challenging. There were handholds, but with my boots on, I couldn&#8217;t get my toes into anyplace where they needed to be. So I basically pulled myself back up the mountain with just my arms.</p>\n<p>I had almost reached Avagdu, but then found that, on this side, I could actually get to where my pack was hanging and take that off his hands. So I headed over there, got a hold on it, and had him drop the cord. Then I traversed off in the other direction a bit till I found a spot where I could securely stash the pack. I untied the paracord from it, wrapped it around my hand, and went back to the spot where the pack had previously been dangling, right below Avagdu. Tossing one end of the cord back up, I instructed him to tie it onto his pack. He did so, and I said that he should then slowly lower the pack down to where I was. I would hold onto the end of the cord and he would lower from above, acting as a sort of pulley in the three-point system. He lowered it down till I could grab it. I put it on my back and had him drop the cord, then traversed back over to my pack and stashed his next to it.</p>\n<p>Avagdu came over till he was directly above me and I guided him down to where I was. He wasn&#8217;t comfortable moving down the mountain with his pack on, so I donned my own and climbed down 30 feet or so till I found another spot where I could take it off and stash it. Then I had him slowly lower his own pack to me via the paracord. When I could grab it, he would drop the cord and I would stash his pack with mine and wait for him to make his way down.</p>\n<p>We repeated this procedure a couple times till the slope of the rock eased up again and the going was simpler. I figured he could make it down easily enough with the pack on. I made my own way down to a sort of mini-cirque where I could stand comfortably and wait for him.</p>\n<p>Avagdu made his way down, dragging his pack along side him. Above where I was standing he announced that he was going to drop his pack. I assumed he meant that he would hold on to one end of the cord that was still tied to the pack. I got out of the way and saw him toss down the pack without holding onto the cord. Turning around, I watched the pack tumble off the cliff behind me and vanish from sight.</p>\n<p>Luckily Avagdu could watch it fall down the mountain from his higher vantage point. He saw it land in a finger of greenery that shot up into the rocks from the treeline below. It was a bit off from the path that I had intended to follow back down.</p>\n<p>We went down a ways before I dropped my pack and said that I would go down into the bushes and retrieve his. I knew he was physically tired at this point and the fact that he had just thrown his pack off a mountain suggested that he was somewhat mentally exhausted. I didn&#8217;t think he needed to climb down, beat around the bushes for a bit, and then climb back up till where we could continue our planned descent.</p>\n<p>The bushes were thick. I poked around a bit and, not finding anything, climbed back up till where I could see Avagdu. I yelled up to him, asking exactly where he saw the pack come in. He replied that he couldn&#8217;t be sure from the spot where he was. I silently thought to myself &#8220;Well you need to be fucking sure! I can&#8217;t scour this whole mountain for the pack that you threw off it.&#8221; But rather than voicing my thoughts, I turned around and dived into another spot in the bushes and small trees. Pushing my way through, I stumbled upon the pack. I looked it over briefly and nothing appeared to be broken, so I threw it on my back and began the hard climb back up to where Avagdu waited. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that again,&#8221; I suggested as I returned his pack.</p>\n<p>I knew that my internal frustration toward Avagdu was unjustified. I was supposed to be the experienced one who was leading this little venture. I could only blame myself for anything that occurred. It pointed at my own mental exhaustion. We both needed to sit down, hydrate, and eat something. In the distance below us I could spot the rock that we rested on as soon as we had broken out of the tree line on the way up. I took off for that.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843644105/" title="Avagdu Descends Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/4843644105_8e179477b7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Descends Townsend" /></a></p>\n<p>From there it was only an hour&#8217;s easy climb back down to the lake, so I didn&#8217;t have any problem draining my last liter of water. After drinking, I threw down a Clif Bar. Feeling much better after that, I yelled out a bit of guidance to Avagdu, who was a little ways behind me but doing a good job of making his way down. As he approached, he teased me, saying my problem was that I confused backpacking with mountaineering. I smiled, but replied honestly that in my book they were the same thing. I couldn&#8217;t spot a difference. Later, I reminded him that before heading out I had told him that this would be an easy, mellow trip. &#8220;I&#8217;m a man of my word,&#8221; I said.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844265364/" title="Avagdu Descends Townsend by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4844265364_568d6231ac.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Descends Townsend" /></a></p>\n<p>After Avagdu had drank and eaten something, I led the way back down. I broke off from the marked route after a few hundred feet, favoring what looked like a more direct path. It went through a bit thicker bush, but I still think it ended up being a quicker descent.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844268992/" title="Second Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/4844268992_c9f80627a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Second Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>Since the family of three had gone, we decided to make camp in the larger clearing opposite the creek from where we had camped the previous night. I quickly threw up my tarp, filled up my water containers, gathered some firewood, and cooked an early dinner while Avagdu was still pitching his own tarp. It was about 5 PM. We were both glad to be back at the lake, and I had my mind set on that inner tube and fishing rod again. After Avagdu pitched his tarp, he helped to gather a bit more wood before filtering water for himself. I had finished my rice before he started to cook his own meal, but I waited around for a bit to get a little digestion happening before getting into the lake.</p>\n<p>When I jumped on the tube, the cold water was invigorating and refreshing. I kicked around the lake a little bit while Avagdu ate his meal. Eventually I tired of that and thought I would see what I could do about getting some line wet.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4843664275/" title="Reflection and Driftwood in Eagle Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/4843664275_f70ff587e6.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Reflection and Driftwood in Eagle Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>On the second or third cast I noticed a small trout investigating my scavenged lure, but he wouldn&#8217;t bite. I tried to get the next cast in that general area and, by luck, succeeded. As soon as it hit, I felt the bite and started to reel it in. But the line snapped and the little guy made off with my hook. I have no idea what type of line was in the reel or what its age or condition was, but it also might have been the fault of my knot. I tried casting a few more times with a couple of the different hooks and lures that I had in my pocket kit, but had no luck. All the fish were jumping for the bugs on top of the water, but none but the one who had taken my lure seemed interested in anything under the surface. A fly rod would probably have been the weapon of choice.</p>\n<p>Avagdu and I hung out on the logs on the shore of the lake until the sun dipped below Merchant Peak once more. As the sun left, the mosquitoes appeared. We decided to return to the camp and light up the fire to smoke all the bugs out.</p>\n<p>On the way down the mountain, Avagdu had ripped out the stitching on one of the bottom compression straps on his pack. It was his first field repair, so I loaned him the kit from <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/24/the-humble-boonie-hat/">my hat</a> to sew it up. I advised an X-ed box stitch. After preparing my second dinner, I looked back to his sewing and saw his creative interpretation of a box stitch. We both laughed as I pointed out what I had meant by a box stitch. His stitching looked plenty strong for the job, so it didn&#8217;t much matter. Embolden by his sewing success, Avagdu decided to use the Reflectix material I had given him to make his first pot cozy.</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening was spent talking around the fire. There had been a few thick logs stacked next to the fire ring. After our fire had got good and hot I was able to arrange three of the thick logs into a tripod and had them burning strongly in a manner that probably would have heated us all night, had we wanted it. Around 11 PM we retired to our bags for sleep.</p>\n<p>I awoke once at 2 AM to get up and pee. The fire was still burning brightly.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844287062/" title="Smoke in the Trees by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/4844287062_844f885903.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Smoke in the Trees" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4844300614/" title="Stone Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/4844300614_28e3cf3151.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Stone Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>Next morning I slept in, awakening at 8 AM to find Avagdu already tending the fire and cooking breakfast. We had a slow morning, eating, talking, and packing. Late in the morning we left Eagle Lake and returned through Paradise Meadow to Stone Lake. Then, it was an easy hike back down to Barclay Lake.</p>\n<p>It was the hottest day of the trip. When we reached Barclay Lake I took off my shirt and jumped in (much to the the chagrin of some of the family day hikers who were there, I think). I swam for about a minute before getting out and eating a little beef jerky followed by granola while drying off. After Avagdu had eaten something we hit the trail again for the final stretch back to the trailhead.</p>\n<p>Avagdu had a bus to catch late that afternoon, so I set a 4 mph pace.

This plant was, and still is, highly respected, for even to eat a small portion of it would result in loss of consciousness, followed by death. It is sometimes known as \'skookum\' root, the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chinook_jargon">Chinook jargon</a> for \'strong, powerful.\' This plant was an important and respected medicine, used by most northwest coast groups. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tlingit">Tlingit</a> used an Indian-hellebore medicine for colds. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nisga%27a">Nisga\'a</a> used small quantities of the root for toothache. There is one report of a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Haisla_people">Haisla</a> who was cured of tuberculosis by placing a lozenge of dried Indian-hellebore root under his tongue for a day. It is said that his face went numb, but he recovered. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Haida">Haida</a> made a poultice for sprains, bruises, and rashes, and a medicine for colds. It was believed almost any disease could be cured with Indian hellebore. The Haida also treated kidney and bladder troubles and acute fevers with this plant. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nuxalk_Nation">Nuxalk</a> made preparations for chronic coughs, gonorrhea, constipation, stomach pains, chest pains, heart trouble and for toothache or rotting teeth. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Kwakwaka%27wakw">Kwakwak\'wakw</a> made medicinal preparations for constipation, internal back and chest pains, colds and to abort pregnancy.

    vellum_post_51.body = u'This past week, <a href="http://kevinisageek.org/">Kevin</a> arrived in Seattle for the last leg of his America trip. I couldn\'t let him come all the way from Scotland without seeing a few mountains, so we had planned a four day trip into the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak_Wilderness">Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>. <a href="http://stormthewire.blip.tv/">Avagdu</a>\'s schedule had recently opened up, allowing him to come up from California to join us. I had planned a loop of about 47 miles around the ridges just southwest of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak">Glacier Peak</a>.\n\nWe arrived at the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sauk_River_%28Washington%29#North_Fork">North Fork Sauk River</a> trailhead late in the morning and, after quickly adjusting gear, hit the trail at 11:30 AM.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813199225/" title="Avagdu Preps at the Trailhead by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4813199225_afab0a2445.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Preps at the Trailhead" /></a>\n\nThe trail paralleled the north fork of the Sauk and led into forests of old-growth cedar, with forest floor covered in <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Western_Skunk_Cabbage">Skunk Cabbage</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Devil%27s_Club">Devil\'s Club</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813833762/" title="Kevin and Avagdu on Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4813833762_47d87c5bfa.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu on Trail" /></a>\n\nWe quickly reached the junction with the Pilot Ridge trail, which heads south, cuts over the river, and begins to climb the ridge. Originally I had thought we would have to ford the river at this point, but there were a few logs laying across that allowed us to easily avoid getting wet.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813216183/" title="Kevin Negotiates the River Crossing by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4813216183_fab81275f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin Negotiates the River Crossing" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813844402/" title="Avagdu Crosses the River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4813844402_c850e534f7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Crosses the River" /></a>\n\nOn the other side of the river we adjusted packs a bit while <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813846860/in/set-72157624547195924/">Avagdu filtered water</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813225255/" title="Three Packs by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4813225255_f1b4b3b4b7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Three Packs" /></a>\n\nThe trail up to Pilot Ridge gains about 3,000 feet in 2 miles. That qualifies as steep by most definitions. It\'s times like that when all the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/physical-training/">physical training</a> (particularly on <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/02/21/mailbox-redux/">Mailbox Peak</a>) really pays off. I find that the easiest way to tackle a steep climb like that is to set a slow pace and keep on climbing with a minimal amount of rest stops -- stopping and starting sucks a lot of energy. Kevin was able to keep up a pretty good pace for most of the steep part of the climb. Avagdu lagged behind a bit, but did much better than <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/02/19/camp/">the last time we went on a hike</a>. I wanted to keep both of them in sight, which meant extra work for me. I would walk with Kevin, then stop and stand around for a few minutes, waiting for Avagdu to catch up. After walking with Avagdu for a bit, I would cruise on ahead, catch up with Kevin, and walk with him for a time before stopping and waiting for Avagdu again.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813230723/" title="Avagdu Films Kevin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4813230723_33c7dd9887.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Films Kevin" /></a>\n\nLuckily the steepest section of switchbacks quickly led to a more gradual climb, so I didn\'t have to maintain my inefficient pacing for too long. As the trail leveled off a bit, I would walk ahead and find the path so that the other two didn\'t have to worry about navigating.\n\nWe hit our first small patches of snow at around 4,200 feet. Near 4,500 feet the patches became larger and began to obscure the trail. The snow slowed the pace of the others a little bit, which provided time for me to go ahead and find where the trail came out on the other side of the snow.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813864240/" title="Kevin and Avagdu Observe First Patch of Snow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4813864240_62fbd6a1b3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu Observe First Patch of Snow" /></a>\n\nWe came out of the trees at 5,100 feet and were greeted by views of Glacier Peak in the east, Sloan Peak in the west, and Mt. Rainer far away to the south. I could just make out the top of Mt. Baker sticking above the clouds in the north.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813257981/" title="Avagdu and Sloan Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4813257981_8245a785b0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu and Sloan Peak" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813254421/" title="Mt. Rainier Far to the South by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4813254421_4f0fb2ec05.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mt. Rainier Far to the South" /></a>\n\nThe snow fields became more constant at this point, so we donned gaiters before continuing further. When we did move on, the trail dropped a couple hundred feet down into the trees again for a short time before regaining the elevation and opening up to a beautiful alpine traverse of the ridge. At this point we were walking the wilderness boundary, with one foot in the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Henry_M._Jackson_Wilderness">Henry M. Jackson Wilderness</a> and the other in the Glacier Peak Wilderness.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813876640/" title="Kevin and Avagdu Traverse Snow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4813876640_5db5148980.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu Traverse Snow" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813888628/" title="Avagdu and Kevin on Slippery Snow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4813888628_60b683c85d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu and Kevin on Slippery Snow" /></a>\n\nWhat was supposed to be open meadows filled with wildflowers atop the ridge turned out to still have significant snow fields on it. Many of these were too steep for us to safely walk directly across, so we would have to either go above or below them. Either way it was steep going.\n\nWhen we would reach a large snow field, Kevin and Avagdu would wait on the trail while I went ahead and cruised above, below, or across it (or all three), searching for where the trail came out and the best route to the other side. It was nerve racking when we were unable to avoid the snow fields, as neither Kevin or Avagdu had much experience in that kind of mountain travel. I would go first and kick steps as they continued behind. I think it\'s safe to say that they both now have more snow experience than the average recreational backpacker. They\'re both well on their way to becoming certified mountain goats!\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813903866/" title="Avagdu Films by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4813903866_a03a2e2b6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Films" /></a>\n\nOur intended destination for the first day was Blue Lake. We had gotten a later start than I had planned and the steep climb mixed with snow had slowed our pace some. At 8:30 PM we were still about a mile and a half from the lake. There had been no running water since climbing the ridge, so all three of us were thirsty. As I climbed to the top of one snow field to scout out the route I noticed a few dry and flat spots at the top of the ridge. After glissading back down I put it to the others that we could continue to the lake, which at our pace and given the snow we wouldn\'t reach till probably a little after dark, or we could spend a night on top the ridge. Water would be the issue on the ridge -- it would take us some time and work to gather enough of the sparsely available wood to build a good fire and melt enough snow. They elected to spend the night on the ridge, which I thought was a good choice.\n\nI had climbed back up and was waiting for the others when I heard a yell from behind. Turning around I saw a solitary fellow standing a couple hundred feet away. It was a surprise to see anyone else out here in this remote area -- particularly since we were off the trail at this point -- so I walked over to say hello. It turns out he was a local hunter who was up there to glass the slopes. He had his tent setup in a bare spot behind a clump of trees. When I told him our predicament he invited us to camp there with him. Kevin and Avagdu had made it up at this point, so we all introduced ourselves and prepared to make camp. When I mentioned that we were hoping to melt snow for water, the hunter said that just over on the other side of the ridge were a few small puddles of snow melt that he had used to fill his bottles. I left to go pump water for the three of us. With Avagdu\'s Dromlite and my Platypus we had 8 liters, which was enough for that evening and the following morn.\n\nWhen I returned Kevin and Avagdu had their tarps up and the hunter had a small fire going. I threw on a couple warmer layers of clothing and pitched my own shelter. Kevin quickly cooked a bit of dinner on his stove and went straight to bed. Avagdu and I stayed up a bit later eating dinner and chatting with the hunter. He knew the area pretty well and showed me on the map where I could find a few unmarked hunting trails. We also talked a bit about Kifaru packs and tarps, both of which he wanted for himself. He crawled into his tent to sleep and Avagdu and I retreated to our tarps soon thereafter.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813908666/" title="Camp on Pilot Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4813908666_f6eb1873d9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp on Pilot Ridge" /></a>\n\nI slept in a bit, waking around 7 AM to find Kevin and Avagdu both already awake and starting on breakfast. The hunter had been up early with his binoculars. He hadn\'t seen much and was breaking his camp, preparing to head back down to the trailhead.\n\nTemperatures that night probably dropped to a few degrees below freezing. I slept well in my cozy 20&#176;F bag, but the others didn\'t have so restful a night. Both had been cold, and the ground that Avagdu had pitched on turned out to have a slight angle so that he was slowly sliding off the mountain all night.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813304257/" title="Breaking Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4813304257_ccbc6dc813.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Breaking Camp" /></a>\n\nThat morning there were clouds filling the valley on either side of the ridge. We were cut off from the world below, isolated in the mountains.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813288389/" title="Glacier Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4813288389_c951454087.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Glacier Peak" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813292353/" title="Across a Sea of Clouds by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4813292353_ca1ee4fd44.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Across a Sea of Clouds" /></a>\n\nAfter breakfast we went down the slope to where we had left the trail the previous evening. As we did so the clouds moved in from the valley below, covering us in fog. I went ahead to scout out the route, but couldn\'t see more than a hundred feet in any direction. We were in a white out. It wasn\'t safe to travel, so we stopped where we were and had a sit, waiting for the clouds to burn off.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813929934/" title="Morning Fog by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4813929934_5e26d8453d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Morning Fog" /></a>\n\nThe clouds did burn off in about an hour and we once again had blue, sunny skies. We continued on much as the last day, doing our best to avoid dangerous snow fields, which inevitably meant steep going, both up and down.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813313925/" title="Avagdu Climbs a Slope by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4813313925_b0e5bf1598.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Climbs a Slope" /></a>\n\nWe were coming to the end of the ridge. As I scouted ahead I was able to see a good deal of our future route. It looked like we would be able to get to the lake without much trouble, but past that the snow got worse. I would have continued on if I was by myself, but I felt responsible for the others and didn\'t feel comfortable leading them on into even more difficult terrain. When I returned to where they were resting I told them that the original plan was out. I proposed that we could continue to the lake and spend a night there before turning around, or spend another night at the camp from last night, or head back down to the north fork of the Sauk and spend a night or two down there. They decided to turn around and head back to the river.\n\nSince we knew that the next stretch would be dry, we first stopped by last night\'s camp and filled up our water containers with the snow melt.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813320357/" title="Avagdu Filters Snow Melt by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4813320357_7aa98b8647.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Filters Snow Melt" /></a>\n\nAfter snacking a bit, we headed out once more to retrace our route from yesterday. It was now near noon.\n\nHeading back across the ridge was easier going than the previous day. I knew the land now and could lead them across a more efficient route. Plus, we were rested, and, going down hill, there were lots of opportunities for quick and fun glissading. Soon we were back in the trees.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813950382/" title="Kevin and Avagdu on the Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4813950382_75e831c3a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu on the Trail" /></a>\n\nWe stopped for lunch at about 4 PM before heading onto the steep switchbacks that lead down to the bottom of the valley.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813953274/" title="Lunch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4813953274_0179188ce0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Lunch" /></a>\n\nWe reached the river around 7PM. Both Avagdu and Kevin had wet feet from traversing the snow, so I had collected a bunch of firewood on the way down and strapped it to my pack. After crossing the river we pitched our tarps and I went to go pump another 8 liters of water for us. We all processed the wood I had brought down and quickly had a bright fire burning. That night we all went to bed an hour or so after dark.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813332767/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4813332767_85ce1ef547.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="South Fork Sauk River" /></a>\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813341307/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4813341307_efc64f26e5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="South Fork Sauk River" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813343985/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4813343985_1c1580aa75_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="South Fork Sauk River" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813338077/" title="Evening at the River Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4813338077_8c936bbc6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Evening at the River Camp" /></a>\n\nThe next morning I woke around 6 AM and peeked out of my tarp to see if anybody had the fire going. No one was up. I continued to sleep a bit and look out every 30 minutes, until 8 AM rolled around and finally I decided that I better get up. There weren\'t enough hot coals left in the fire to blow it back to life, so I started it again with a cotton ball. The others came over soon after I had thrown a few pieces of wood on the blaze.\n\nThat day we didn\'t have any plans. Late in the morning I jumped in the river to rinse off the previous two days worth of sweat and sunblock. I couldn\'t convince Kevin to get in, but Avagdu braved the water for a few seconds before declaring it too cold.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813978348/" title="River Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4813978348_e569b2ea5d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="River Camp" /></a>\n\nI collected a bunch more wood for the evening\'s fire.

    vellum_post_51.body_rendered = u'<p>This past week, <a href="http://kevinisageek.org/">Kevin</a> arrived in Seattle for the last leg of his America trip. I couldn&#8217;t let him come all the way from Scotland without seeing a few mountains, so we had planned a four day trip into the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak_Wilderness">Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>. <a href="http://stormthewire.blip.tv/">Avagdu</a>&#8216;s schedule had recently opened up, allowing him to come up from California to join us. I had planned a loop of about 47 miles around the ridges just southwest of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Glacier_Peak">Glacier Peak</a>.</p>\n<p>We arrived at the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sauk_River_%28Washington%29#North_Fork">North Fork Sauk River</a> trailhead late in the morning and, after quickly adjusting gear, hit the trail at 11:30 AM.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813199225/" title="Avagdu Preps at the Trailhead by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4813199225_afab0a2445.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Preps at the Trailhead" /></a></p>\n<p>The trail paralleled the north fork of the Sauk and led into forests of old-growth cedar, with forest floor covered in <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Western_Skunk_Cabbage">Skunk Cabbage</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Devil%27s_Club">Devil&#8217;s Club</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813833762/" title="Kevin and Avagdu on Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4813833762_47d87c5bfa.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu on Trail" /></a></p>\n<p>We quickly reached the junction with the Pilot Ridge trail, which heads south, cuts over the river, and begins to climb the ridge. Originally I had thought we would have to ford the river at this point, but there were a few logs laying across that allowed us to easily avoid getting wet.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813216183/" title="Kevin Negotiates the River Crossing by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4813216183_fab81275f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin Negotiates the River Crossing" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813844402/" title="Avagdu Crosses the River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4813844402_c850e534f7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Crosses the River" /></a>\n\n<p>On the other side of the river we adjusted packs a bit while <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813846860/in/set-72157624547195924/">Avagdu filtered water</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813225255/" title="Three Packs by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4813225255_f1b4b3b4b7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Three Packs" /></a></p>\n<p>The trail up to Pilot Ridge gains about 3,000 feet in 2 miles. That qualifies as steep by most definitions. It&#8217;s times like that when all the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/physical-training/">physical training</a> (particularly on <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/02/21/mailbox-redux/">Mailbox Peak</a>) really pays off. I find that the easiest way to tackle a steep climb like that is to set a slow pace and keep on climbing with a minimal amount of rest stops &#8212; stopping and starting sucks a lot of energy. Kevin was able to keep up a pretty good pace for most of the steep part of the climb. Avagdu lagged behind a bit, but did much better than <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/02/19/camp/">the last time we went on a hike</a>. I wanted to keep both of them in sight, which meant extra work for me. I would walk with Kevin, then stop and stand around for a few minutes, waiting for Avagdu to catch up. After walking with Avagdu for a bit, I would cruise on ahead, catch up with Kevin, and walk with him for a time before stopping and waiting for Avagdu again.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813230723/" title="Avagdu Films Kevin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4813230723_33c7dd9887.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Films Kevin" /></a></p>\n<p>Luckily the steepest section of switchbacks quickly led to a more gradual climb, so I didn&#8217;t have to maintain my inefficient pacing for too long. As the trail leveled off a bit, I would walk ahead and find the path so that the other two didn&#8217;t have to worry about navigating.</p>\n<p>We hit our first small patches of snow at around 4,200 feet. Near 4,500 feet the patches became larger and began to obscure the trail. The snow slowed the pace of the others a little bit, which provided time for me to go ahead and find where the trail came out on the other side of the snow.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813864240/" title="Kevin and Avagdu Observe First Patch of Snow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4813864240_62fbd6a1b3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu Observe First Patch of Snow" /></a></p>\n<p>We came out of the trees at 5,100 feet and were greeted by views of Glacier Peak in the east, Sloan Peak in the west, and Mt. Rainer far away to the south. I could just make out the top of Mt. Baker sticking above the clouds in the north.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813257981/" title="Avagdu and Sloan Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4813257981_8245a785b0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu and Sloan Peak" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813254421/" title="Mt.

When we did move on, the trail dropped a couple hundred feet down into the trees again for a short time before regaining the elevation and opening up to a beautiful alpine traverse of the ridge. At this point we were walking the wilderness boundary, with one foot in the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Henry_M._Jackson_Wilderness">Henry M. Jackson Wilderness</a> and the other in the Glacier Peak Wilderness.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813876640/" title="Kevin and Avagdu Traverse Snow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4813876640_5db5148980.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu Traverse Snow" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813888628/" title="Avagdu and Kevin on Slippery Snow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4813888628_60b683c85d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu and Kevin on Slippery Snow" /></a></p>\n<p>What was supposed to be open meadows filled with wildflowers atop the ridge turned out to still have significant snow fields on it. Many of these were too steep for us to safely walk directly across, so we would have to either go above or below them. Either way it was steep going.</p>\n<p>When we would reach a large snow field, Kevin and Avagdu would wait on the trail while I went ahead and cruised above, below, or across it (or all three), searching for where the trail came out and the best route to the other side. It was nerve racking when we were unable to avoid the snow fields, as neither Kevin or Avagdu had much experience in that kind of mountain travel. I would go first and kick steps as they continued behind. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that they both now have more snow experience than the average recreational backpacker. They&#8217;re both well on their way to becoming certified mountain goats!</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813903866/" title="Avagdu Films by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4813903866_a03a2e2b6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Films" /></a></p>\n<p>Our intended destination for the first day was Blue Lake. We had gotten a later start than I had planned and the steep climb mixed with snow had slowed our pace some. At 8:30 PM we were still about a mile and a half from the lake. There had been no running water since climbing the ridge, so all three of us were thirsty. As I climbed to the top of one snow field to scout out the route I noticed a few dry and flat spots at the top of the ridge. After glissading back down I put it to the others that we could continue to the lake, which at our pace and given the snow we wouldn&#8217;t reach till probably a little after dark, or we could spend a night on top the ridge. Water would be the issue on the ridge &#8212; it would take us some time and work to gather enough of the sparsely available wood to build a good fire and melt enough snow. They elected to spend the night on the ridge, which I thought was a good choice.</p>\n<p>I had climbed back up and was waiting for the others when I heard a yell from behind. Turning around I saw a solitary fellow standing a couple hundred feet away. It was a surprise to see anyone else out here in this remote area &#8212; particularly since we were off the trail at this point &#8212; so I walked over to say hello. It turns out he was a local hunter who was up there to glass the slopes. He had his tent setup in a bare spot behind a clump of trees. When I told him our predicament he invited us to camp there with him. Kevin and Avagdu had made it up at this point, so we all introduced ourselves and prepared to make camp. When I mentioned that we were hoping to melt snow for water, the hunter said that just over on the other side of the ridge were a few small puddles of snow melt that he had used to fill his bottles. I left to go pump water for the three of us. With Avagdu&#8217;s Dromlite and my Platypus we had 8 liters, which was enough for that evening and the following morn.</p>\n<p>When I returned Kevin and Avagdu had their tarps up and the hunter had a small fire going. I threw on a couple warmer layers of clothing and pitched my own shelter. Kevin quickly cooked a bit of dinner on his stove and went straight to bed. Avagdu and I stayed up a bit later eating dinner and chatting with the hunter. He knew the area pretty well and showed me on the map where I could find a few unmarked hunting trails. We also talked a bit about Kifaru packs and tarps, both of which he wanted for himself. He crawled into his tent to sleep and Avagdu and I retreated to our tarps soon thereafter.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813908666/" title="Camp on Pilot Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4813908666_f6eb1873d9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp on Pilot Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>I slept in a bit, waking around 7 AM to find Kevin and Avagdu both already awake and starting on breakfast. The hunter had been up early with his binoculars. He hadn&#8217;t seen much and was breaking his camp, preparing to head back down to the trailhead.</p>\n<p>Temperatures that night probably dropped to a few degrees below freezing. I slept well in my cozy 20&#176;F bag, but the others didn&#8217;t have so restful a night. Both had been cold, and the ground that Avagdu had pitched on turned out to have a slight angle so that he was slowly sliding off the mountain all night.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813304257/" title="Breaking Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4813304257_ccbc6dc813.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Breaking Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>That morning there were clouds filling the valley on either side of the ridge. We were cut off from the world below, isolated in the mountains.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813288389/" title="Glacier Peak by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4813288389_c951454087.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Glacier Peak" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813292353/" title="Across a Sea of Clouds by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4813292353_ca1ee4fd44.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Across a Sea of Clouds" /></a></p>\n<p>After breakfast we went down the slope to where we had left the trail the previous evening. As we did so the clouds moved in from the valley below, covering us in fog. I went ahead to scout out the route, but couldn&#8217;t see more than a hundred feet in any direction. We were in a white out. It wasn&#8217;t safe to travel, so we stopped where we were and had a sit, waiting for the clouds to burn off.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813929934/" title="Morning Fog by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4813929934_5e26d8453d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Morning Fog" /></a></p>\n<p>The clouds did burn off in about an hour and we once again had blue, sunny skies. We continued on much as the last day, doing our best to avoid dangerous snow fields, which inevitably meant steep going, both up and down.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813313925/" title="Avagdu Climbs a Slope by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4813313925_b0e5bf1598.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Climbs a Slope" /></a></p>\n<p>We were coming to the end of the ridge. As I scouted ahead I was able to see a good deal of our future route. It looked like we would be able to get to the lake without much trouble, but past that the snow got worse. I would have continued on if I was by myself, but I felt responsible for the others and didn&#8217;t feel comfortable leading them on into even more difficult terrain. When I returned to where they were resting I told them that the original plan was out. I proposed that we could continue to the lake and spend a night there before turning around, or spend another night at the camp from last night, or head back down to the north fork of the Sauk and spend a night or two down there. They decided to turn around and head back to the river.</p>\n<p>Since we knew that the next stretch would be dry, we first stopped by last night&#8217;s camp and filled up our water containers with the snow melt.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813320357/" title="Avagdu Filters Snow Melt by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4813320357_7aa98b8647.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Avagdu Filters Snow Melt" /></a></p>\n<p>After snacking a bit, we headed out once more to retrace our route from yesterday. It was now near noon.</p>\n<p>Heading back across the ridge was easier going than the previous day. I knew the land now and could lead them across a more efficient route. Plus, we were rested, and, going down hill, there were lots of opportunities for quick and fun glissading. Soon we were back in the trees.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813950382/" title="Kevin and Avagdu on the Trail by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4813950382_75e831c3a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kevin and Avagdu on the Trail" /></a></p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch at about 4 PM before heading onto the steep switchbacks that lead down to the bottom of the valley.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813953274/" title="Lunch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4813953274_0179188ce0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Lunch" /></a></p>\n<p>We reached the river around 7PM. Both Avagdu and Kevin had wet feet from traversing the snow, so I had collected a bunch of firewood on the way down and strapped it to my pack. After crossing the river we pitched our tarps and I went to go pump another 8 liters of water for us. We all processed the wood I had brought down and quickly had a bright fire burning. That night we all went to bed an hour or so after dark.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813332767/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4813332767_85ce1ef547.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="South Fork Sauk River" /></a>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813341307/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4813341307_efc64f26e5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="South Fork Sauk River" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813343985/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4813343985_1c1580aa75_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="South Fork Sauk River" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4813338077/" title="Evening at the River Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4813338077_8c936bbc6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Evening at the River Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>The next morning I woke around 6 AM and peeked out of my tarp to see if anybody had the fire going.

There weren&#8217;t enough hot coals left in the fire to blow it back to life, so I started it again with a cotton ball.

It\'s been a bit over a year now since I started using them. At the same time I switched over to Platypus, I also started treating my water with chemicals rather than filtering it. Both methods of treatment have their advantages and disadvantages, but lately I have been using chemicals almost exclusively.\n\nA water filter, of course, filters out not only the invisible nasties that upset the stomach, but also the visible things things that don\'t cause much harm but aren\'t altogether pleasant: dirt, dead bugs, small rocks, and the like. When I moved to using chemicals I was just dumping the water into my drinking vessel direct from the source. Without any sort of filter, the water could sometimes be a bit gritty. Too textured for my taste.\n\nAs a first attempt to solve this I started to place a bandanna over the opening of the Platypus, and then poured the source water over that. That worked great for getting out the sediment, but then I had the problem of having a wet rag. If the sun is out, it dries, but the other 307 days of the year, the bandanna -- even a synthetic Buff -- became a bit of a hassle to dry. I wanted some sort of pre-filter that I could get wet without worrying about it.\n\nThe solution (like more than a few before it) came while browsing the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com">BackpackingLight</a> forums.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4790268567/" title="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4790268567_8a73e40bd3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap" /></a>\n\nA <a href="http://www.ron-vik.com/filters.aspx">filter washer</a> is a rubber washer with a mesh screen in the middle. Apparently they\'re used in garden hoses and washing machines to remove sediment. I was able to find them easily in the plumbing section of a local hardware store.\n\nI took an old Platypus cap and drilled out the center of it. Then, with a little Gorilla Glue, glued the filter washer onto the cap. That\'s all there is to it! The new pre-filter cap weighs 2 grams (0.07 oz) and shouldn\'t cost much more than $1 to make.\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4790264139/" title="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4790264139_4051511b46_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4790899198/" title="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4790899198_9c97a88aca_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\nThe downside to the pre-filter cap is that it does noticeably decrease the flow rate of the water. To fill the Platypus, I use a scoop made out of an older Platypus bottle with the top cut off. Without the pre-filter cap, it takes all of 30 seconds to fill the Platypus bottle. With the pre-filter cap, it takes something more like 2 minutes to fill up the bottle. I have to pour the water out of the scoop much more slowly.

Apparently they&#8217;re used in garden hoses and washing machines to remove sediment. I was able to find them easily in the plumbing section of a local hardware store.</p>\n<p>I took an old Platypus cap and drilled out the center of it. Then, with a little Gorilla Glue, glued the filter washer onto the cap. That&#8217;s all there is to it! The new pre-filter cap weighs 2 grams (0.07 oz) and shouldn&#8217;t cost much more than $1 to make.</p>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4790264139/" title="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4790264139_4051511b46_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4790899198/" title="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4790899198_9c97a88aca_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DIY Platypus Pre-Filter Cap" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The downside to the pre-filter cap is that it does noticeably decrease the flow rate of the water. To fill the Platypus, I use a scoop made out of an older Platypus bottle with the top cut off. Without the pre-filter cap, it takes all of 30 seconds to fill the Platypus bottle. With the pre-filter cap, it takes something more like 2 minutes to fill up the bottle. I have to pour the water out of the scoop much more slowly.

Jackson Wilderness</a> (just the other side of Cadet Peak from <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/02/01/goat-lake/">Goat Lake</a>) and see what the snow was doing. The hike up to the basin goes uphill alongside a waterfall that carries away the melting snow, as well as melt from <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Columbia_Glacier_%28Washington%29">Columbia Glacier</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4737303864/" title="Looking up to Glacier Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4737303864_50f16a07ff.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Looking up to Glacier Basin"/></a>\n\nThe whole drainage, including the trail, had been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4736673119/in/set-72157624240085357/">hit by at least one major avalanche</a> somewhat recently, leaving lots of debris and snapped trees for me to climb over. The hike was hot, but enjoyable. I encountered no snow until just before the basin at 4,500 feet. Before venturing further, I stopped to put on my gaiters, take out my other trekking pole and put the snow baskets on both. I almost always forget to pack the snow baskets for my poles, so I was excited to have remembered them this time around. Heading on into the snow, my pace slowed. It was now late afternoon -- just about the worst time to attempt to traverse a snow field on an inclined slope. The sun had been beating down on the snow all day, making it soft and prone to slipping. I managed not to fall off any mountains, but, due to my lack of snowshoes, did posthole up to my crotch two different times. Soon enough I made it to a scree field just inside the basin.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4737310796/" title="Glacier Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4737310796_07be893138.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Glacier Basin"/></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4737314054/" title="Glacier Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4737314054_fca6d78584.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Glacier Basin"/></a>\n\nMy original plan had been to spend the night up here, but it didn\'t look very promising. I dropped my pack in order to be a little lighter on my feet and took off to survey the basin. Most of it was still covered in the same deep, wet snow that I struggled through at the entrance. I didn\'t fancy sleeping on this. The areas that were melted were rocky and devoid of any flat spaces. I imagine it will be mostly cleared up in another couple weeks, but for now I decided to turn around and spend the night at a lower elevation.\n\nI managed not to sink or slip on the snow field on the way out. Retracing my steps, I made my way back down along the waterfall. The avalanche had exposed a lot of smooth rock that, wet with snow melt, made for slippery going. Near the bottom I slipped and slid down about ten feet on my side, slicing open my left knee. It was a 3" long incision across the front of the patella, but not very deep. I continued on the trail for a bit, letting it bleed. As long as it\'s not a gusher, letting wounds ooze a little blood helps to clean them out.\n\nFive minutes further down I found a nice rock sit on. I dropped my pack, grabbed the first aid kit, and pulled out <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/06/19/irrigation-syringe/">my syringe</a>. It took just under a liter of water to fully clean the cut. I had noticed a patch of yarrow further up the trail, but there didn\'t seem to be any around my rock. Instead, there was a large <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tsuga_heterophylla">hemlock tree</a> that must have been knocked down by the recent avalanche. It still looked green and alive. When I punctured it with my knife, it oozed sap. I used this to cover the cut. The sap is antiseptic and forms a barrier to keep dirt or anything else from the wound. Plus, it smells good! After the sap had dried, I bandaged it and carried on down the trail, arriving back at Monte Cristo at 7PM. I had dinner in the town and took advantage of the long summer evening to scout out an agreeable place to sleep in the surrounding forest.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4736680727/" title="Monte Cristo Evening by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4736680727_63d91ac55a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Monte Cristo Evening"/></a>\n\nThe following morning I breakfasted and started to head back to the trailhead. On the way out I decided to make a short detour up to Gothic Basin. As with neighboring Glacier Basin the climb was mostly clear, but I hit deep snow just at the entrance. After looking around a bit I climbed back down and finished the walk back to the road, arriving at the trailhead late that morning.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4737318330/" title="South Fork Sauk River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4737318330_1088b1462f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="South Fork Sauk River"/></a>'

    vellum_post_61.body = u'I went on a lengthy bike ride around the Seattle area yesterday. There were a couple of errands I wanted to run in the city and I thought I\'d use them as an excuse to test out <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/biking-directions-added-to-google-maps.html">Google Maps new bicycle directions feature</a>, which I had yet to use.\n\nThe Interurban Trail runs through <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Interurban_Trail_%28Snohomish_County%29">Snohomish</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Interurban_Trail_%28King_County%29">King</a> Counties, forming a highway for human powered transport. At least, that\'s the idea. Parts of the trail are on old railway routes and parts are on normal city streets. The part of the trail in King county is great, but the Snohomish county trail is very poorly signed and notoriously difficult to follow as it moves between trail sections and streets. If you\'ve never ridden it before, you\'re guaranteed to lose it. Since the trail parallels <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Interstate_5">I-5</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Washington_State_Route_99">99</a>, it\'s difficult to actually get lost -- just keep heading north or south and you\'ll eventually get where you\'re going -- but it\'s nice to be able to stay on the trail itself as the Interurban\'s route is generally the friendliest to non-motorized vehicles.\n\nI was very impressed with Google\'s ability to keep me on the trail. The directions only once told me to turn onto a non-existent road. Other than that, they proved accurate. I also had with me photocopies of the relevant route directions taken from <a href="http://www.bikingpugetsound.com/">Biking Puget Sound</a>. The directions from both were very similar, but where they differed, I found that Google\'s route was superior.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nOf course, the whole trip couldn\'t be on the trail. I had to get on the Interurban at the beginning of my ride and off it at the end. For that bit, I was also happy with Google\'s directions. The route on and off the trail was not as direct as the one I would have chosen myself, but Google seemed to go out of their way to keep me on smaller streets with less traffic. It\'s clear that Google takes topography into account, as well, as the streets that Google suggested were flatter than those on the more direct route that I would have chosen.\n\nThe downside to Google\'s route was the number of turns. The directions were 7 pages long for the full trip (both to my destination and from the destination back to my starting point). I think the longest section I had without a turn was about 2 miles. I would make a turn, pull the directions out of my pocket to see how long I had on this stretch and what the next turn would be, shove the directions back into my pocket, go on for a bit, make the turn, and repeat the process. It was a bit inconvenient, shoving the directions into my pocket and pulling them out so frequently, and the directions got crinkled and difficult to read. I need to figure out someway to mount them on my handlebars. The other problem with the directions was that, because much of the Interurban is on the old railway that doesn\'t have street names, Google would occasionally give a direction like "Turn left in 58 feet". Turn left? Turn left where? In this driveway? That business parking lot? The lake? With the infrequent signage on the trail itself, I would often miss these mysterious left turns. When that happened I would look a couple steps ahead on the directions till it had me turning onto a street with a number.

    vellum_post_61.body_rendered = u'<p>I went on a lengthy bike ride around the Seattle area yesterday. There were a couple of errands I wanted to run in the city and I thought I&#8217;d use them as an excuse to test out <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/biking-directions-added-to-google-maps.html">Google Maps new bicycle directions feature</a>, which I had yet to use.</p>\n<p>The Interurban Trail runs through <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Interurban_Trail_%28Snohomish_County%29">Snohomish</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Interurban_Trail_%28King_County%29">King</a> Counties, forming a highway for human powered transport. At least, that&#8217;s the idea. Parts of the trail are on old railway routes and parts are on normal city streets. The part of the trail in King county is great, but the Snohomish county trail is very poorly signed and notoriously difficult to follow as it moves between trail sections and streets. If you&#8217;ve never ridden it before, you&#8217;re guaranteed to lose it. Since the trail parallels <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Interstate_5">I-5</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Washington_State_Route_99">99</a>, it&#8217;s difficult to actually get lost &#8212; just keep heading north or south and you&#8217;ll eventually get where you&#8217;re going &#8212; but it&#8217;s nice to be able to stay on the trail itself as the Interurban&#8217;s route is generally the friendliest to non-motorized vehicles.</p>\n<p>I was very impressed with Google&#8217;s ability to keep me on the trail. The directions only once told me to turn onto a non-existent road. Other than that, they proved accurate. I also had with me photocopies of the relevant route directions taken from <a href="http://www.bikingpugetsound.com/">Biking Puget Sound</a>. The directions from both were very similar, but where they differed, I found that Google&#8217;s route was superior.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Of course, the whole trip couldn&#8217;t be on the trail. I had to get on the Interurban at the beginning of my ride and off it at the end. For that bit, I was also happy with Google&#8217;s directions. The route on and off the trail was not as direct as the one I would have chosen myself, but Google seemed to go out of their way to keep me on smaller streets with less traffic. It&#8217;s clear that Google takes topography into account, as well, as the streets that Google suggested were flatter than those on the more direct route that I would have chosen.</p>\n<p>The downside to Google&#8217;s route was the number of turns. The directions were 7 pages long for the full trip (both to my destination and from the destination back to my starting point). I think the longest section I had without a turn was about 2 miles. I would make a turn, pull the directions out of my pocket to see how long I had on this stretch and what the next turn would be, shove the directions back into my pocket, go on for a bit, make the turn, and repeat the process. It was a bit inconvenient, shoving the directions into my pocket and pulling them out so frequently, and the directions got crinkled and difficult to read. I need to figure out someway to mount them on my handlebars. The other problem with the directions was that, because much of the Interurban is on the old railway that doesn&#8217;t have street names, Google would occasionally give a direction like &#8220;Turn left in 58 feet&#8221;. Turn left? Turn left where? In this driveway? That business parking lot? The lake? With the infrequent signage on the trail itself, I would often miss these mysterious left turns. When that happened I would look a couple steps ahead on the directions till it had me turning onto a street with a number. I could make my way to that numbered street along normal roads and soon find myself back on Google&#8217;s route.</p>\n<p>Overall I was pleased with the directions and will definitely be taking advantage of Google again for future trips &#8212; though if it&#8217;s in an area that I have no familiarity with, I would probably want to supplement them with a good road map for added security.

But water just poured over a wound won\'t do much good. Pressure is needed. Occasionally you might hear people claim that you can fill up a ziploc bag with water, cut or poke a hole in one corner, and squeeze the bag to force out a stream of water. That\'s certainly better than nothing, but in my experience the pressure from that is not comparable to the pressure from a syringe. With an irrigation syringe, you can take the cleanest water available (usually your drinking water) and shoot it into the wound. Pressure washing the wound like this allows you to easily clean out all the grit and dirt. There\'s no need to go poking around in there with unsanitary tools, probably causing more harm than good. A 12cc syringe like the one I carry costs <a href="http://www.nols.edu/store/product.php?productid=16249">$1</a>, weighs 8 grams (0.28 oz), and takes up very little room. I can\'t think of a reason not to have one in your pack!\n\nRemember: a clean wound is a happy wound. You can put all the effort you want into the perfect bandage, but if the wound isn\'t clean, you\'re going to have some problems down the line.'

Occasionally you might hear people claim that you can fill up a ziploc bag with water, cut or poke a hole in one corner, and squeeze the bag to force out a stream of water. That&#8217;s certainly better than nothing, but in my experience the pressure from that is not comparable to the pressure from a syringe. With an irrigation syringe, you can take the cleanest water available (usually your drinking water) and shoot it into the wound. Pressure washing the wound like this allows you to easily clean out all the grit and dirt. There&#8217;s no need to go poking around in there with unsanitary tools, probably causing more harm than good. A 12cc syringe like the one I carry costs <a href="http://www.nols.edu/store/product.php?productid=16249">$1</a>, weighs 8 grams (0.28 oz), and takes up very little room. I can&#8217;t think of a reason not to have one in your pack!</p>\n<p>Remember: a clean wound is a happy wound. You can put all the effort you want into the perfect bandage, but if the wound isn&#8217;t clean, you&#8217;re going to have some problems down the line.</p>'

It\'s held a first aid kit, notes, and small clothing items like gloves and a hat. For the past 6 months it has functioned as my camera case. You may remember that <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">back when I did an EDC post</a> I mentioned in the photo notes for my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3863588194/">level 2 items</a> that I wrapped my camera in a bandanna for padding and then put that in a waterproof Aloksak. The problem with that setup is that Aloksaks aren\'t incredibly durable, nor are they cheap. I can\'t afford to replace them every time they fail. So I moved to putting the bandanna-wrapped camera in the 2 liter Ultra-Sil sack. It\'s just as waterproof (if not more so), but also more durable. The other benefit to using the Ultra-Sil is that I have plenty of room left over in the sack to dump in my cell phone when traveling in the wilderness.\n\n<h2>13L Ultra-Sil</h2>\n\nThe 13 liter Ultra-Sil I bought last Fall to hold my sleeping bag. Prior to this I used a <a href="http://kifaru.net/stuffsack.html">Kifaru Compression Stuff Sack</a>. The Kifaru sacks are great at compressing bulky items down. Patrick <a href="http://kifaru.net/reg_stufhist.htm">developed</a> them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705120998/in/set-72157624160363947/">compress around the circumference of the item</a>, rather than length wise, so that they actually fit in the bottom of a pack (strangely enough, a novel idea). They\'re made of a lightweight and waterproof material, but only close with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705117514/in/set-72157624160363947/">a drawstring closure</a>. This means that water can potentially creep inside. I\'ve used one of these sacks in some capacity since 2007 and never once had an item get wet, but it\'s always a risk. The other issue for me is that I rarely ever max out the capacity of my pack. I can afford the space for bulky items and don\'t <em>need</em> to compress them. So I decided to start using the Ultra-Sil sack for my sleeping bag. They don\'t compress, but they guarantee that my sleeping bag will always stay dry and, due to the lack of compression straps, the Ultra-Sils are lighter than the Kifaru sacks. (The small Kifaru compression sack -- which I use for both my 20F bag and my 40F bag -- weighs 68 grams, or 2.4 oz.) The 13 liter is a good size for my 20F bag. The 8 liter is a better size for my 40F bag, but because I only have one 8 liter sack and it\'s always used for clothing, I usually end up using the 13 liter sack when carrying my 40F bag as well.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705111694/" title="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a 13L Ultra-Sil by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4020/4705111694_5e695f4f3b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a 13L Ultra-Sil" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4704473657/" title="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a #1 (small) Kifaru Compression Sack by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4704473657_62f212b51b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a #1 (small) Kifaru Compression Sack" /></a>\n\nThe only thing that I don\'t like about the Ultra-Sil sacks is lack of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705123068/in/set-72157624160363947/">a grab handle on the bottom</a>. When I stuff my sleeping bag into the sack and purge out the air, it gets packed in there pretty well. To remove it I have to hold the bottom of the sack. Since there\'s no grab loop, that means that I have to pinch the bottom, which also means pinching the sleeping bag itself. It\'s not a big deal, but a grab loop on the bottom would make removing the sleeping bag ever-so-slightly easier.\n\nIf you\'re looking to keep gear dry without a large penalty in weight, I would strongly recommend picking up two or three of the Ultra-Sil Dry Sacks.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705131752/" title="Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4705131752_8da9090ce7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack" /></a>\n\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n\n<dl>\n<dt>2 L Ultra-Sil</dt>\n<dd>20 grams / 0.7 oz</dd>\n<dt>8 L Ultra-Sil</dt>\n<dd>30 grams / 1 oz</dd>\n<dt>13 Ultra-Sil</dt>\n<dd>42 grams / 1.5 oz</dd>\n</dl>'

The problem with that setup is that Aloksaks aren&#8217;t incredibly durable, nor are they cheap. I can&#8217;t afford to replace them every time they fail. So I moved to putting the bandanna-wrapped camera in the 2 liter Ultra-Sil sack. It&#8217;s just as waterproof (if not more so), but also more durable. The other benefit to using the Ultra-Sil is that I have plenty of room left over in the sack to dump in my cell phone when traveling in the wilderness.</p>\n<h2>13L Ultra-Sil</h2>\n\n<p>The 13 liter Ultra-Sil I bought last Fall to hold my sleeping bag. Prior to this I used a <a href="http://kifaru.net/stuffsack.html">Kifaru Compression Stuff Sack</a>. The Kifaru sacks are great at compressing bulky items down. Patrick <a href="http://kifaru.net/reg_stufhist.htm">developed</a> them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705120998/in/set-72157624160363947/">compress around the circumference of the item</a>, rather than length wise, so that they actually fit in the bottom of a pack (strangely enough, a novel idea). They&#8217;re made of a lightweight and waterproof material, but only close with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705117514/in/set-72157624160363947/">a drawstring closure</a>. This means that water can potentially creep inside. I&#8217;ve used one of these sacks in some capacity since 2007 and never once had an item get wet, but it&#8217;s always a risk. The other issue for me is that I rarely ever max out the capacity of my pack. I can afford the space for bulky items and don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to compress them. So I decided to start using the Ultra-Sil sack for my sleeping bag. They don&#8217;t compress, but they guarantee that my sleeping bag will always stay dry and, due to the lack of compression straps, the Ultra-Sils are lighter than the Kifaru sacks. (The small Kifaru compression sack &#8212; which I use for both my 20F bag and my 40F bag &#8212; weighs 68 grams, or 2.4 oz.) The 13 liter is a good size for my 20F bag. The 8 liter is a better size for my 40F bag, but because I only have one 8 liter sack and it&#8217;s always used for clothing, I usually end up using the 13 liter sack when carrying my 40F bag as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705111694/" title="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a 13L Ultra-Sil by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4020/4705111694_5e695f4f3b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a 13L Ultra-Sil" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4704473657/" title="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a #1 (small) Kifaru Compression Sack by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4704473657_62f212b51b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Kifaru 20F Slick Bag in a #1 (small) Kifaru Compression Sack" /></a></p>\n<p>The only thing that I don&#8217;t like about the Ultra-Sil sacks is lack of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705123068/in/set-72157624160363947/">a grab handle on the bottom</a>. When I stuff my sleeping bag into the sack and purge out the air, it gets packed in there pretty well. To remove it I have to hold the bottom of the sack. Since there&#8217;s no grab loop, that means that I have to pinch the bottom, which also means pinching the sleeping bag itself. It&#8217;s not a big deal, but a grab loop on the bottom would make removing the sleeping bag ever-so-slightly easier.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep gear dry without a large penalty in weight, I would strongly recommend picking up two or three of the Ultra-Sil Dry Sacks.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4705131752/" title="Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4705131752_8da9090ce7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack" /></a>\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n<dl>\n<dt>2 L Ultra-Sil</dt>\n<dd>20 grams / 0.7 oz</dd>\n<dt>8 L Ultra-Sil</dt>\n<dd>30 grams / 1 oz</dd>\n<dt>13 Ultra-Sil</dt>\n<dd>42 grams / 1.5 oz</dd>\n</dl></p>'

One of the categories of gear that I have been focusing on of late are my tarp stakes. For the past year and a half I have attempted to discover what works best by experimenting with four different types of stakes in a wide variety of ground conditions. The stakes I\'ve used are <a href="http://www.durapeg.com/">Durapegs</a> (6"), <a href="http://gossamergear.com/shelters/shelter-accessories/tite-lite-tent-stake-long-188.html">Tite-Lite Titanium Stakes</a> (6.5"), <a href="http://gossamergear.com/shelters/shelter-accessories/easton-aluminum-tent-stakes.html">Easton Aluminum Stakes</a> (6.25"), and <a href="http://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Accessory/X-pegSuperlightStakes">Big Agnes X-peg Stakes</a> (7").\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4701172796/" title="Different Stakes by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/4701172796_e12085fe0b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Different Stakes" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2>Big Agnes X-peg Stakes</h2>\nThe X-pegs measure 7" in length, are made of aluminum, and tip the scale at 11 grams (0.38oz). They came with my old <a href="http://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/SeedhouseSL1">Seedhouse SL1</a>, which was the last tent I bought before moving to tarps. The four-sided design gives them a lot of grip in the earth and the notched top securely grabs cordage or a webbing tie out. It\'s a pretty basic design, but effective in many types of earth. I\'ve beat on these stakes for some time and haven\'t bent or broken one in any use.\n\n<h2>Easton Aluminum Stakes</h2>\nThe Easton stakes are 6.25" long, also made of aluminum, and weigh 8 grams (0.28oz). These are popular stakes with lightweight backpackers. They have a nice flat head to hammer on with a rock and a small cordage loop at the top to make pulling them out of the ground very easy.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4701232216/" title="Easton Aluminum Stake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4701232216_b6257bab30.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Easton Aluminum Stake" /></a>\n\nAt first glance, one would expect the Easton stakes to be inferior to the X-pegs. Though both are made of aluminum, the Easton stake is hollow, which makes it lighter but easier to break. The body of the Easton stake is cylindrical and smooth so that it doesn\'t grip in the earth as well as the four-sided X-peg. Despite all this, I have yet to break or bend an Easton stake. I have also never had one accidentally pull out.\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4701223446/" title="Easton Aluminum Stake Head by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1278/4701223446_7960ab1e80_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Easton Aluminum Stake Head" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4701287266/" title="Easton Aluminum Stake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4701287266_5b4b883e8d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Easton Aluminum Stake" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tite-Lite Titanium Stakes</h2>\nThe Tite-Lite is a 6.5" titanium stake that weighs only 6 grams (0.2oz). It\'s a simple stake in the classic shepherd hook design. Though the weight is great, this is the least functional and my least favorite of the bunch. Because of the small diameter it will go into most any ground, but it will also pull out. I\'ve had these stakes come out in the middle of a windstorm, forcing me to get up three or four different times during the night to replant them (the Easton stakes and Durapegs were also in use at the same time and never once came out). They twist in the ground fairly easily, allowing cordage and webbing tie outs to slip off. And in very rocky ground, they will bend.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700629937/" title="Bent Titanium Shepard Hook Stake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4700629937_5d941e9468.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bent Titanium Shepard Hook Stake" /></a>\n\nFor me, there\'s too much functionality sacrificed for the savings in weight. I no longer use these.\n\n<h2>Durapeg</h2>\nThe Durapeg is 6" long, made of ABS plastic, and weighs 14 grams (0.49oz). These are the stakes that <a href="http://kifaru.net/">Kifaru</a> sells with all their <a href="http://www.kifaru.net/tarps_hootches.html">shelters</a>. Similar to the X-peg, they are four-sided and have wide indents on two sides to grip the dirt. There\'s a flat top for pounding on and a good hook to hold a tie out. Once you put these things in the ground, they don\'t tend to move.  Despite the fact that they\'re the heaviest of the bunch, they\'re also my favorite. They simply have proven themselves to be the most effective stake in the widest array of ground conditions. The wide indentations on either side eat a whole lot of ground, making them better in snow and sand than the X-pegs (though they certainly aren\'t the best option for a dedicated snow stake).\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700570357/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4700570357_79f6e95094.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Durapeg" /></a>\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700552289/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4700552289_3659cc3ed2_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Durapeg" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700560995/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1293/4700560995_878b7b02ea_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Durapeg" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700581513/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4700581513_2696d21659_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Durapeg" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\nI have had a Durapeg bend in very rocky ground but, unlike with the Tite-Lite, the bend in the Durapeg was not enough to affect the functionality. Still, the bent Durapeg has been removed from my rotation. I have yet to have any of these break, but I\'m afraid that the bend will be enough to snap the Durapeg if I tried to pound that particular stake into really hard ground again.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700645335/" title="Bent Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4700645335_8450352d7a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bent Durapeg" /></a>\n\nThe top of the Durapeg does get chewed up a bit after being beat on with a few rocks. So far this hasn\'t proved to weaken or in any other way damage the stake overall. I\'ve also had some pitting occur on the flat head of the Easton stake due to being driven in with rocks.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4701241670/" title="Durapeg and Easton Aluminum Stake Heads by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4701241670_b6d746e622.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Durapeg and Easton Aluminum Stake Heads" /></a>\n\n<h2>Current Carry</h2>\nMy <a href="http://kifaru.net/tarps_hootches.html">Kifaru Paratarp</a> has 12 different tie out points. Using all of these allows one to get a real tight pitch, but I find is almost always unnecessary. When I\'m pitching the tarp in an elevated manner by tying it out to trees, the most that I\'ll need are 4 stakes -- one for each corner. When pitched in the normal manner with trekking poles, I find that 7 stakes are all that are needed for a good pitch. An eighth stake placed in the webbing tie out between the front and middle tie out on whichever side I\'m sleeping on will widen out the shelter a bit and give me more head space. I carry 8 stakes. Currently those 8 stakes consist of 6 Durapegs and 2 Eastons. Also in the bag are 4 <a href="http://www.niteize.com/collections/figure-9/products/figure-9-small-1">Nite-Ize Figure 9s</a> which help me to pitch the tarp from trees or toss up a clothesline or a place to hang a water bladder. The bag itself a lightweight silnylon thingy that came as the stake bag with the Big Agnes Seedhouse SL1.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4701303442/" title="Stake Package by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4701303442_4daf9fbcc1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Stake Package" /></a>\n\nThe whole package -- bag, stakes, and Figure 9s -- weighs 122g or 4.3oz. With this (and a couple hanks of paracord) I find that I can throw up a secure and comfortable shelter in just about any condition. Occasionally I\'ll switch out a couple of the Durapegs for a couple X-pegs, but currently I prefer the greater holding power of the former.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691296179/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4691296179_5cfd4ec6f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp" /></a>\n\nI do still have two of the lightweight Tite-Lite stakes that I carry with my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/01/18/trail-designs-ti-tri-titanium-stove-system/">Ti-Tri</a>. These serve to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207579947/">elevate the pot in wood-burning mode</a>. If I want to I can use these when pitching the tarp to bring up the total number of stakes to 10, but I rarely do.\n\nIf anybody has a favorite stake different from the ones discussed here -- and it weighs 14g or less -- let me know about it! I\'m always looking to improve the package.'

The wide indentations on either side eat a whole lot of ground, making them better in snow and sand than the X-pegs (though they certainly aren&#8217;t the best option for a dedicated snow stake).</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700570357/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4700570357_79f6e95094.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Durapeg" /></a>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700552289/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4700552289_3659cc3ed2_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Durapeg" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700560995/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1293/4700560995_878b7b02ea_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Durapeg" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700581513/" title="Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4700581513_2696d21659_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Durapeg" /></a></li>\n</ul></p>\n<p>I have had a Durapeg bend in very rocky ground but, unlike with the Tite-Lite, the bend in the Durapeg was not enough to affect the functionality. Still, the bent Durapeg has been removed from my rotation. I have yet to have any of these break, but I&#8217;m afraid that the bend will be enough to snap the Durapeg if I tried to pound that particular stake into really hard ground again.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4700645335/" title="Bent Durapeg by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4700645335_8450352d7a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bent Durapeg" /></a></p>\n<p>The top of the Durapeg does get chewed up a bit after being beat on with a few rocks. So far this hasn&#8217;t proved to weaken or in any other way damage the stake overall.

Using all of these allows one to get a real tight pitch, but I find is almost always unnecessary. When I&#8217;m pitching the tarp in an elevated manner by tying it out to trees, the most that I&#8217;ll need are 4 stakes &#8212; one for each corner. When pitched in the normal manner with trekking poles, I find that 7 stakes are all that are needed for a good pitch. An eighth stake placed in the webbing tie out between the front and middle tie out on whichever side I&#8217;m sleeping on will widen out the shelter a bit and give me more head space. I carry 8 stakes. Currently those 8 stakes consist of 6 Durapegs and 2 Eastons. Also in the bag are 4 <a href="http://www.niteize.com/collections/figure-9/products/figure-9-small-1">Nite-Ize Figure 9s</a> which help me to pitch the tarp from trees or toss up a clothesline or a place to hang a water bladder.

With this (and a couple hanks of paracord) I find that I can throw up a secure and comfortable shelter in just about any condition. Occasionally I&#8217;ll switch out a couple of the Durapegs for a couple X-pegs, but currently I prefer the greater holding power of the former.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691296179/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4691296179_5cfd4ec6f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>I do still have two of the lightweight Tite-Lite stakes that I carry with my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/01/18/trail-designs-ti-tri-titanium-stove-system/">Ti-Tri</a>.

This past week I did a loop of about 60 miles in the Wilderness.\n\nI arrived at the Panjab trailhead in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucannon_River">Tucannon</a> canyon at around 3PM on Saturday. The plan for the day was to take a short walk and spend the night at Dunlap Spring, a distance of about 6 miles. The Panjab trail proved uneventful, with no interesting sightings. I reached the meadow above the spring at 6PM and was happy to see it free of snow. The meadow sits at 5,700 feet (around 2,500 feet higher than the trailhead) which was not the highest elevation I would be reaching during the loop, but close. It seemed a safe bet that I wouldn\'t be post holing the whole trip, which is always good news.\n\nAs I walked down the meadow toward the spring, I ran into my first local. A black bear with a nice brown coat was having his supper about a hundred feet away. He had his butt toward me and his head down. I yelled a greeting. He didn\'t budge. Not exactly the response I was hoping for. I yelled a bit more and he looked around but was either blind or uninterested in the biped waving frantically at him. After a minute, though, the wind shifted direction and brought my scent to him. He turned his head to look right at me, then ran off into the trees. Thanking him, I went on my way.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI found the spring without any trouble and filled up my water bladder. After pitching my tarp in a nice spot in the trees a little ways away, I started to think about dinner. The sky was clear that evening and there was a spot up on the meadow that would provide a nice seat to watch the sun as it set into the West. I grabbed my food, stove, and water and headed on up. Along the way I grabbed a few small sticks and twigs to fuel the stove. After dinner and the show I headed back down into the trees and climbed into bed at 9:30PM.\n\nSunday morning I awoke to a light sprinkle. No matter. I thought it\'d be good to get a few miles under my belt before breakfast. I got out of bed and topped off my water at the spring. Just as I was about to start breaking down my small camp, the rain really started coming down. Maybe breakfast later on down the trail wasn\'t such a good idea. It seemed like a better option to crawl back under the tarp and do a little breakfast from bed.\n\nThat proved a good choice. Just as I was finishing my noodles the rain stopped. I took advantage of the lull to quickly break camp and get on my way. Most of the day\'s walk was along high meadows that should have provided good views to either side, but everything was covered in cloud and I was unable to see more than a hundred feet or so in any direction for all the mist.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691910764/" title="Misty Meadow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4691910764_252c037689.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Misty Meadow" /></a>\n\nOccasional small breaks in the cloud provided a hint of the country I was traveling through and I did manage to spot a herd of seven elk having breakfast further down the meadow.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691907486/" title="Meadow on a Cloudy Day by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4691907486_bf7329b093.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Meadow on a Cloudy Day" /></a>\n\nThe trail was gaining elevation and started to enter a few trees. Snow covered the ground. It was only a few inches deep and pretty crusty so I didn\'t sink in, but it obscured the trail. I was looking around trying to decide where the trail might have gone when I spotted a pair of really big bear tracks. "Aha," I thought. "Those are heading in the right direction. I\'ll follow them." The tracks led on through the trees and I followed (hoping not to meet the fellow who left the tracks). Eventually the tracks led out of the trees and deposited me on the trail at exactly where I wanted to be: the aptly named Bear Wallow Spring.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691913384/" title="Bear Wallow Spring by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1283/4691913384_3cf67ed94a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bear Wallow Spring" /></a>\n\nFrom then on whenever I lost the trail in the snow I would just follow the tracks of bear or elk. They always seem to know where they\'re going and tend to take the most efficient route to get there.\n\nThe trail continued east along the ridge, with a steep drop-off on the south side. At its highest point it got to around 6,200 feet, but there still was no more than a few inches of snow. The trail passed Squaw Spring, which was a disgusting mess of a hunter\'s camp, and Sheephead Spring before finally reaching the high point at Diamond Spring. From that point my route turned south as I began a long, slow descent down into the canyon toward Oregon. I had been in fog all day and just as I started to descend the canyon I heard thunder off in the west. Whoops! That high open ridge was about the last place I wanted to be. I picked up the pace a bit and started to loose elevation. Safely back in the trees I spooked another elk, grazing all by his lonesome.\n\nAs I slowly (very slowly) lost elevation I began to get underneath the clouds and started to see a bit more of the country. Lots of canyons all around, and somewhere down there to the south the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenaha_River">Wenaha River</a>. Oregon Trail country. (Briefly, I relived childhood fears of <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-have-died-of-dysentery">dying of dysentery</a>.)\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691917960/" title="View South of Diamond Spring by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4691917960_bb44b5e912.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="View South of Diamond Spring" /></a>\n\nAt one point I misplaced my foot and starting to slide down the slope to my right. Throwing out my left hand I was able to stop myself but scraped up the palm of my hand in the process. Right where I fell was a patch of yarrow, which I grabbed and put on my palm as a poultice. After walking for another half hour or so I found a good spot to stop and properly clean and bandage the wound.\n\nContinuing on, the trail finally finished its descent into the canyon and met up with Melton Creek. At 7PM I stopped to cook up dinner. The local ants were apparently of the mind that my meal was lacking in protein: a few of them crawled into the pot and ended up in my tummy. As I was eating dinner I spotted movement on the opposite side of the canyon. At first I thought it was an elk, but it turned out to be another black bear, this time with a light brown coat of fur around the body and dark fur around the neck and head. Just like an elk! Neat.\n\nAnother few miles down the trail and I finally arrived at the confluence of Melton Creek and Crooked Creek, where I intended to camp. After filling up my water supply and cleaning the pot from dinner, I pitched my tarp and crawled right in. It was a little after 9PM. I had walked around 17 miles that day.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691292189/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1307/4691292189_969675bab1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp" /></a>\n\nMonday morning it was raining. It was to be a short day -- I had only about 7 miles to go -- so I decided I would wait it out. The rain fell for a good while as I killed time in the tarp.\n\n<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=ff255beeac&photo_id=4692168842"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=ff255beeac&photo_id=4692168842" height="300" width="400"></embed></object>\n\nFinally it stopped and I got out of bed, hitting the trail near 11AM. Just a few steps down the trail I had my first water crossing of the trip. I had to get to the other side of Melton Creek just north of where it joins with Crooked Creek. The water was cold, but only about knee deep. Another mile down the trail was another crossing, so I just left my sandals on and my shoes hanging around my neck.\n\nWhen I got to it, First Creek proved to be a bit deeper and very fast moving. Had I slipped and fallen in Melton Creek I would have been cold and wet and might have come out with a bruised bum or stubbed toe, but it looked like if I was to fall here in First Creek I could actually get swept down it a ways.\n\nThe creek was waist deep. I made it across with no more trouble than frozen privates -- which was trouble enough -- but the creek also proved to be the boundary between winter and summer. Just as I got to the other side the sun popped out and the temperatures were soon in the mid-70F degrees. A bit downstream from the crossing was an old cabin and horse corral. I headed over there to cook up a brunch and dry out in the sun.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691298963/" title="Crooked Creek Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4691298963_603aedc06e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Crooked Creek Canyon" /></a>\n\nBack on the trail, the bush got really thick as I headed south down the side of Crooked Creek. I might as well have been bushwhacking, but the sun was out and there wasn\'t a cloud in the sky so it didn\'t much matter. A mile or so down the "trail" I ran into a mule train. They had just packed in an <a href="http://www.thesca.org/">SCA</a> crew down at the Oregon border who would be spending the summer working on this trail. Good luck! In a couple weeks it\'ll be getting way to hot for me down in that canyon, but I\'m glad that somebody will be working the trail. The guy at the head of the mule train seemed impressed when I told him my route -- more so because I was solo. "That\'s quite a walk!" he said. Before I had gotten on the trail, I was in the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeroy,_Washington">Pomeroy</a> where I ran into a couple locals. They described the Wilderness as "bumfuck nowhere" and tried to discourage me from going in by myself. Apparently people who live in the region don\'t venture into the Wenaha-Tucannon very often. Seems strange to me.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691304385/" title="Crooked Creek Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4691304385_a79e64cbef.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Crooked Creek Canyon" /></a>\n\nSoon after passing the mules I reached the Oregon border. Just off in the trees I found the trail crew having lunch. I headed over to say hello and swap stories about the SCA. Since this was their very first day, they were all still looking pretty neat and clean. One of the girls even had makeup on! I imagine they\'ll look a bit different come August. Anyway, I wished them good luck and continued on my way, soon reaching the point where Melton Creek drains into the Wenaha River. Here, my route turned west and headed upstream along the river.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691311907/" title="Wenaha River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4691311907_96f15855aa.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wenaha River" /></a>\n\nThe Wenaha River and its canyon really are beautiful. It\'s not the sort of area I associate with the Northwest, instead seeming like it belongs somewhere in Montana. At this point the day had warmed up till it was somewhere around 80F which seemed to please the two rattlesnakes I found hanging out in the middle of the trail.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691945876/" title="Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4691945876_c71347df1d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wenaha River Canyon" /></a>\n\nI reached Fairview Bar just after 5PM and, after dropping my pack, stripped down and jumped in the river. It wasn\'t any warmer than the ball-freezing First Creek, but was refreshing after the hot hike. After getting out of the Wenaha I threw up the tarp and collected water while drying off in the sun. I dressed as the sun began to sink below the canyon wall. Then, laying my pad out on the ground, I had a good sit. It lasted about 3 hours. During that time I cooked up dinner and paid a little attention to my feet, which were hurting due to the new footwear I was trying out.\n\nWhile I was digging in my food bag for dinner I came across the chocolate bar I packed. I always like to pack a bar of chocolate in the cooler months when it won\'t melt. Emergency Chocolate, I call it. Not only is it tasty and mentally comforting, but it provides a great energy boost and can be helpful in warding off hypothermia. When I pulled it out of the bag it was still firm, but I said to myself "Self, look at this here chocolate bar. With warm temperatures like today, it\'s going to melt in no time! We better eat it before that happens." To which I replied "I like the way you think, Self" and proceeded to eat the whole thing.\n\nThe next day I woke determined not to lounge around in bed that morning, but to get an early start on the day. I had a long and steep climb north out of the canyon ahead of me and wanted to get most of it done before the sun started beating down. Quickly breaking camp, I threw on my pack and started heading uphill just past 6AM. Sunrise in the Wenaha is a wonderful time. Undoubtedly, that leg of the trip had the best scenery.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691954176/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4691954176_e075551d27.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a>\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691949768/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4691949768_37fea6c64d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691320313/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4691320313_f9b2d114aa_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691955590/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4691955590_0b458ca5c2_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n Around 7:30AM I reached the trees and stopped to cook breakfast at the base of an old pine. I spotted two ospreys flying over head.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691951650/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1285/4691951650_d6108a7a07.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a>\n\nAfter that, my hike was through forest. Soon I was back in Washington. I lost the trail a couple times and stumbled upon another hunting camp, but found my way up out of the trees without much trouble.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691965498/" title="Hunter\'s Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4691965498_d63cb94462.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Hunter\'s Camp" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4692092906/" title="Smooth Ridge Forest by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4692092906_8829021124.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Smooth Ridge Forest" /></a>\n\nThere are some great grassy ridges up there around Moore Flat and Smooth Ridge that demand one to at least have a sit on them, if not take a nap. I did a bit of both.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691450411/" title="Pack Below Smooth Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1300/4691450411_a7877a2a47.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pack Below Smooth Ridge" /></a>\n\nSoon I reached the top of Weller Butte and the highest point of elevation for the day. Lodgepole Spring, where I planned to spend the night, was just another few miles north of that.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691466761/" title="Rainbow at Smooth Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4048/4691466761_512d99914e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Rainbow at Smooth Ridge" /></a>\n\nLodgepole Spring was a bit disappointing when I got there. It was fairly muddy and finding a good spot to put the tarp was difficult. Despite the day\'s perfect weather, some clouds had started to move in and it was looking like rain. Eventually I found a spot a bit above the spring that was sort of flat and had a few trees around it to help protect from any wind. Most of an Elk skeleton lay beside it.\n\nThe wind did pick up and got pretty strong that night. I was cozy inside my tarp, but I had pitched the front left side a little sloppily which meant that it was making a lot of noise as the slack got blown back and forth in the wind. It woke me a couple times, but I was too comfy inside my bag to get up and do anything about it.\n\nThe next morning was rainy and windy. Still, I didn\'t want to hang out in the tarp all morning. I broke camp, filled up on water at the spring, and headed on my way. Around 10AM the sky cleared up and the sun came out for another fine summer day.\n\nAs I headed north, I was gaining elevation. I went along the narrow ridge along Danger Point and a bit further on reached <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/153260/oregon-butte.html">Oregon Butte</a> -- at 6387 feet, the highest point in the Wilderness area. Just north of Oregon Butte I reentered the snow and lost the trail. There was a confusing intersection with three or four trails heading off in different directions at that point and I wanted to make sure I got on the right one. I spent 20 minutes looking around for the correct trail -- or even an area where the trail might be likely to go -- but couldn\'t find anything. Finally I gave up and just started heading cross country via map and compass along the route that the trail should have gone. About a mile further I had lost enough elevation for the snow to disappear and I found the trail again. I was only off by about 10 feet in my route calculations.\n\nJust after noon the sky started to fill up with clouds again and darken. "More rain!" I thought. Then I heard a rumble. And another. And another. The storm was just northwest of me and heading in my direction. Once again I was up on top of an exposed ridge, the highest thing all around. I dropped off the trail and heading down to the tree line. Picking up my pace a bit, I paralleled the trail and kept my eyes open to see what would happen. I hadn\'t seen any lightning yet, but the thunder was getting nasty.\n\nOriginally my plan had been to spend the night at Dunlap Spring again and then head out back to the trailhead the next morning. If the storm kept up though, I didn\'t want to spend the night that high. I reached the meadow above the spring at 3PM. Just as I came out of the trees it started to hail. The thunder sounded like it was right on top of me at this point and I saw a flash or two of lightning. I decided I needed to get down. I started to half walk, half run toward the Panjab Trail that heads down into the trees toward the trailhead. Just before I reached the meadow I encountered another bear. This one was about 50 feet away, oblivious to my presence. I yelled at him. He didn\'t budge. I was anxious to get down, but this guy was standing right where I wanted to go. Yelling at him again, he looked up at me and shook his coat, throwing water all over. "Yeah," I yelled "it sure is wet up here, isn\'t it? I bet it would be nice and dry in those trees down there! <em>Wink wink nudge nudge</em>." Apparently bears don\'t understand winks because he didn\'t take my hints. He just kept doing what he was doing. More yelling and waving my arms around finally got him to look at me again. He cocked his head as if to express his displeasure at this disruption of his schedule and slowly turned around and waddled off into the trees.\n\nI reached the trees myself soon thereafter. Just as I left the meadow the hail stopped and the storm passed on further east. The clouds hung around and only allowed a few sun breaks the rest of the afternoon, but I was able to dry out. I continued down the trail to just a bit northeast of the trailhead and found a good spot to camp for the night. That evening the sky cleared and I was allowed a view of the awe-some golden sunset in the Tucannon Canyon.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157624129853331/">More photos on Flickr</a>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase.

    vellum_post_68.body_rendered = u'<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenaha%E2%80%93Tucannon_Wilderness">Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness</a> in the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/uma/">Umatilla National Forest</a> is a remote section of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_%28Oregon%29">Blue Mountains</a> located in southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. This past week I did a loop of about 60 miles in the Wilderness.</p>\n<p>I arrived at the Panjab trailhead in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucannon_River">Tucannon</a> canyon at around 3PM on Saturday. The plan for the day was to take a short walk and spend the night at Dunlap Spring, a distance of about 6 miles. The Panjab trail proved uneventful, with no interesting sightings. I reached the meadow above the spring at 6PM and was happy to see it free of snow. The meadow sits at 5,700 feet (around 2,500 feet higher than the trailhead) which was not the highest elevation I would be reaching during the loop, but close. It seemed a safe bet that I wouldn&#8217;t be post holing the whole trip, which is always good news.</p>\n<p>As I walked down the meadow toward the spring, I ran into my first local. A black bear with a nice brown coat was having his supper about a hundred feet away. He had his butt toward me and his head down. I yelled a greeting. He didn&#8217;t budge. Not exactly the response I was hoping for. I yelled a bit more and he looked around but was either blind or uninterested in the biped waving frantically at him. After a minute, though, the wind shifted direction and brought my scent to him. He turned his head to look right at me, then ran off into the trees. Thanking him, I went on my way.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I found the spring without any trouble and filled up my water bladder. After pitching my tarp in a nice spot in the trees a little ways away, I started to think about dinner. The sky was clear that evening and there was a spot up on the meadow that would provide a nice seat to watch the sun as it set into the West. I grabbed my food, stove, and water and headed on up. Along the way I grabbed a few small sticks and twigs to fuel the stove. After dinner and the show I headed back down into the trees and climbed into bed at 9:30PM.</p>\n<p>Sunday morning I awoke to a light sprinkle. No matter. I thought it&#8217;d be good to get a few miles under my belt before breakfast. I got out of bed and topped off my water at the spring. Just as I was about to start breaking down my small camp, the rain really started coming down. Maybe breakfast later on down the trail wasn&#8217;t such a good idea. It seemed like a better option to crawl back under the tarp and do a little breakfast from bed.</p>\n<p>That proved a good choice. Just as I was finishing my noodles the rain stopped. I took advantage of the lull to quickly break camp and get on my way. Most of the day&#8217;s walk was along high meadows that should have provided good views to either side, but everything was covered in cloud and I was unable to see more than a hundred feet or so in any direction for all the mist.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691910764/" title="Misty Meadow by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4691910764_252c037689.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Misty Meadow" /></a></p>\n<p>Occasional small breaks in the cloud provided a hint of the country I was traveling through and I did manage to spot a herd of seven elk having breakfast further down the meadow.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691907486/" title="Meadow on a Cloudy Day by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4691907486_bf7329b093.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Meadow on a Cloudy Day" /></a></p>\n<p>The trail was gaining elevation and started to enter a few trees. Snow covered the ground. It was only a few inches deep and pretty crusty so I didn&#8217;t sink in, but it obscured the trail. I was looking around trying to decide where the trail might have gone when I spotted a pair of really big bear tracks. &#8220;Aha,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;Those are heading in the right direction. I&#8217;ll follow them.&#8221; The tracks led on through the trees and I followed (hoping not to meet the fellow who left the tracks). Eventually the tracks led out of the trees and deposited me on the trail at exactly where I wanted to be: the aptly named Bear Wallow Spring.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691913384/" title="Bear Wallow Spring by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1283/4691913384_3cf67ed94a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Bear Wallow Spring" /></a></p>\n<p>From then on whenever I lost the trail in the snow I would just follow the tracks of bear or elk. They always seem to know where they&#8217;re going and tend to take the most efficient route to get there.</p>\n<p>The trail continued east along the ridge, with a steep drop-off on the south side. At its highest point it got to around 6,200 feet, but there still was no more than a few inches of snow. The trail passed Squaw Spring, which was a disgusting mess of a hunter&#8217;s camp, and Sheephead Spring before finally reaching the high point at Diamond Spring. From that point my route turned south as I began a long, slow descent down into the canyon toward Oregon. I had been in fog all day and just as I started to descend the canyon I heard thunder off in the west. Whoops! That high open ridge was about the last place I wanted to be. I picked up the pace a bit and started to loose elevation. Safely back in the trees I spooked another elk, grazing all by his lonesome.</p>\n<p>As I slowly (very slowly) lost elevation I began to get underneath the clouds and started to see a bit more of the country. Lots of canyons all around, and somewhere down there to the south the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenaha_River">Wenaha River</a>. Oregon Trail country. (Briefly, I relived childhood fears of <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-have-died-of-dysentery">dying of dysentery</a>.)</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691917960/" title="View South of Diamond Spring by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4691917960_bb44b5e912.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="View South of Diamond Spring" /></a></p>\n<p>At one point I misplaced my foot and starting to slide down the slope to my right. Throwing out my left hand I was able to stop myself but scraped up the palm of my hand in the process. Right where I fell was a patch of yarrow, which I grabbed and put on my palm as a poultice. After walking for another half hour or so I found a good spot to stop and properly clean and bandage the wound.</p>\n<p>Continuing on, the trail finally finished its descent into the canyon and met up with Melton Creek. At 7PM I stopped to cook up dinner. The local ants were apparently of the mind that my meal was lacking in protein: a few of them crawled into the pot and ended up in my tummy. As I was eating dinner I spotted movement on the opposite side of the canyon. At first I thought it was an elk, but it turned out to be another black bear, this time with a light brown coat of fur around the body and dark fur around the neck and head. Just like an elk! Neat.</p>\n<p>Another few miles down the trail and I finally arrived at the confluence of Melton Creek and Crooked Creek, where I intended to camp. After filling up my water supply and cleaning the pot from dinner, I pitched my tarp and crawled right in. It was a little after 9PM. I had walked around 17 miles that day.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691292189/" title="Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1307/4691292189_969675bab1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp" /></a></p>\n<p>Monday morning it was raining. It was to be a short day &#8212; I had only about 7 miles to go &#8212; so I decided I would wait it out. The rain fell for a good while as I killed time in the tarp.</p>\n<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=ff255beeac&amp;photo_id=4692168842"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=ff255beeac&amp;photo_id=4692168842" height="300" width="400"></embed></object></p>\n<p>Finally it stopped and I got out of bed, hitting the trail near 11AM. Just a few steps down the trail I had my first water crossing of the trip. I had to get to the other side of Melton Creek just north of where it joins with Crooked Creek. The water was cold, but only about knee deep. Another mile down the trail was another crossing, so I just left my sandals on and my shoes hanging around my neck.</p>\n<p>When I got to it, First Creek proved to be a bit deeper and very fast moving. Had I slipped and fallen in Melton Creek I would have been cold and wet and might have come out with a bruised bum or stubbed toe, but it looked like if I was to fall here in First Creek I could actually get swept down it a ways.</p>\n<p>The creek was waist deep. I made it across with no more trouble than frozen privates &#8212; which was trouble enough &#8212; but the creek also proved to be the boundary between winter and summer. Just as I got to the other side the sun popped out and the temperatures were soon in the mid-70F degrees. A bit downstream from the crossing was an old cabin and horse corral. I headed over there to cook up a brunch and dry out in the sun.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691298963/" title="Crooked Creek Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4691298963_603aedc06e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Crooked Creek Canyon" /></a></p>\n<p>Back on the trail, the bush got really thick as I headed south down the side of Crooked Creek. I might as well have been bushwhacking, but the sun was out and there wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky so it didn&#8217;t much matter. A mile or so down the &#8220;trail&#8221; I ran into a mule train. They had just packed in an <a href="http://www.thesca.org/">SCA</a> crew down at the Oregon border who would be spending the summer working on this trail. Good luck! In a couple weeks it&#8217;ll be getting way to hot for me down in that canyon, but I&#8217;m glad that somebody will be working the trail. The guy at the head of the mule train seemed impressed when I told him my route &#8212; more so because I was solo. &#8220;That&#8217;s quite a walk!&#8221; he said. Before I had gotten on the trail, I was in the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeroy,_Washington">Pomeroy</a> where I ran into a couple locals. They described the Wilderness as &#8220;bumfuck nowhere&#8221; and tried to discourage me from going in by myself. Apparently people who live in the region don&#8217;t venture into the Wenaha-Tucannon very often. Seems strange to me.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691304385/" title="Crooked Creek Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4691304385_a79e64cbef.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Crooked Creek Canyon" /></a></p>\n<p>Soon after passing the mules I reached the Oregon border. Just off in the trees I found the trail crew having lunch. I headed over to say hello and swap stories about the SCA. Since this was their very first day, they were all still looking pretty neat and clean. One of the girls even had makeup on! I imagine they&#8217;ll look a bit different come August. Anyway, I wished them good luck and continued on my way, soon reaching the point where Melton Creek drains into the Wenaha River. Here, my route turned west and headed upstream along the river.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691311907/" title="Wenaha River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4691311907_96f15855aa.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wenaha River" /></a></p>\n<p>The Wenaha River and its canyon really are beautiful. It&#8217;s not the sort of area I associate with the Northwest, instead seeming like it belongs somewhere in Montana. At this point the day had warmed up till it was somewhere around 80F which seemed to please the two rattlesnakes I found hanging out in the middle of the trail.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691945876/" title="Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4691945876_c71347df1d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></p>\n<p>I reached Fairview Bar just after 5PM and, after dropping my pack, stripped down and jumped in the river. It wasn&#8217;t any warmer than the ball-freezing First Creek, but was refreshing after the hot hike. After getting out of the Wenaha I threw up the tarp and collected water while drying off in the sun. I dressed as the sun began to sink below the canyon wall. Then, laying my pad out on the ground, I had a good sit. It lasted about 3 hours. During that time I cooked up dinner and paid a little attention to my feet, which were hurting due to the new footwear I was trying out.</p>\n<p>While I was digging in my food bag for dinner I came across the chocolate bar I packed. I always like to pack a bar of chocolate in the cooler months when it won&#8217;t melt. Emergency Chocolate, I call it. Not only is it tasty and mentally comforting, but it provides a great energy boost and can be helpful in warding off hypothermia. When I pulled it out of the bag it was still firm, but I said to myself &#8220;Self, look at this here chocolate bar. With warm temperatures like today, it&#8217;s going to melt in no time! We better eat it before that happens.&#8221; To which I replied &#8220;I like the way you think, Self&#8221; and proceeded to eat the whole thing.</p>\n<p>The next day I woke determined not to lounge around in bed that morning, but to get an early start on the day. I had a long and steep climb north out of the canyon ahead of me and wanted to get most of it done before the sun started beating down. Quickly breaking camp, I threw on my pack and started heading uphill just past 6AM. Sunrise in the Wenaha is a wonderful time. Undoubtedly, that leg of the trip had the best scenery.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691954176/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4691954176_e075551d27.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691949768/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4691949768_37fea6c64d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691320313/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4691320313_f9b2d114aa_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691955590/" title="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4691955590_0b458ca5c2_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Sunrise Atop the Wenaha River Canyon" /></a></li>\n</ul></p>\n<p>Around 7:30AM I reached the trees and stopped to cook breakfast at the base of an old pine.

Lodgepole Spring, where I planned to spend the night, was just another few miles north of that.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4691466761/" title="Rainbow at Smooth Ridge by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4048/4691466761_512d99914e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Rainbow at Smooth Ridge" /></a></p>\n<p>Lodgepole Spring was a bit disappointing when I got there. It was fairly muddy and finding a good spot to put the tarp was difficult. Despite the day&#8217;s perfect weather, some clouds had started to move in and it was looking like rain. Eventually I found a spot a bit above the spring that was sort of flat and had a few trees around it to help protect from any wind. Most of an Elk skeleton lay beside it.</p>\n<p>The wind did pick up and got pretty strong that night. I was cozy inside my tarp, but I had pitched the front left side a little sloppily which meant that it was making a lot of noise as the slack got blown back and forth in the wind. It woke me a couple times, but I was too comfy inside my bag to get up and do anything about it.</p>\n<p>The next morning was rainy and windy. Still, I didn&#8217;t want to hang out in the tarp all morning. I broke camp, filled up on water at the spring, and headed on my way. Around 10AM the sky cleared up and the sun came out for another fine summer day.</p>\n<p>As I headed north, I was gaining elevation. I went along the narrow ridge along Danger Point and a bit further on reached <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/153260/oregon-butte.html">Oregon Butte</a> &#8212; at 6387 feet, the highest point in the Wilderness area. Just north of Oregon Butte I reentered the snow and lost the trail. There was a confusing intersection with three or four trails heading off in different directions at that point and I wanted to make sure I got on the right one. I spent 20 minutes looking around for the correct trail &#8212; or even an area where the trail might be likely to go &#8212; but couldn&#8217;t find anything. Finally I gave up and just started heading cross country via map and compass along the route that the trail should have gone. About a mile further I had lost enough elevation for the snow to disappear and I found the trail again. I was only off by about 10 feet in my route calculations.</p>\n<p>Just after noon the sky started to fill up with clouds again and darken. &#8220;More rain!&#8221; I thought. Then I heard a rumble. And another. And another. The storm was just northwest of me and heading in my direction. Once again I was up on top of an exposed ridge, the highest thing all around. I dropped off the trail and heading down to the tree line. Picking up my pace a bit, I paralleled the trail and kept my eyes open to see what would happen. I hadn&#8217;t seen any lightning yet, but the thunder was getting nasty.</p>\n<p>Originally my plan had been to spend the night at Dunlap Spring again and then head out back to the trailhead the next morning. If the storm kept up though, I didn&#8217;t want to spend the night that high. I reached the meadow above the spring at 3PM. Just as I came out of the trees it started to hail. The thunder sounded like it was right on top of me at this point and I saw a flash or two of lightning. I decided I needed to get down. I started to half walk, half run toward the Panjab Trail that heads down into the trees toward the trailhead. Just before I reached the meadow I encountered another bear. This one was about 50 feet away, oblivious to my presence. I yelled at him. He didn&#8217;t budge. I was anxious to get down, but this guy was standing right where I wanted to go. Yelling at him again, he looked up at me and shook his coat, throwing water all over. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I yelled &#8220;it sure is wet up here, isn&#8217;t it? I bet it would be nice and dry in those trees down there! <em>Wink wink nudge nudge</em>.&#8221; Apparently bears don&#8217;t understand winks because he didn&#8217;t take my hints. He just kept doing what he was doing. More yelling and waving my arms around finally got him to look at me again. He cocked his head as if to express his displeasure at this disruption of his schedule and slowly turned around and waddled off into the trees.</p>\n<p>I reached the trees myself soon thereafter. Just as I left the meadow the hail stopped and the storm passed on further east. The clouds hung around and only allowed a few sun breaks the rest of the afternoon, but I was able to dry out. I continued down the trail to just a bit northeast of the trailhead and found a good spot to camp for the night. That evening the sky cleared and I was allowed a view of the awe-some golden sunset in the Tucannon Canyon.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157624129853331/">More photos on Flickr</a>\n<blockquote>Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase.

I like the pot, but it has one shortcoming: there are no measuring marks on it. I\'m not comfortable just pouring a little water into a pot and saying "Well, that <em>looks</em> like 2 cups." I prefer a slightly higher level of accuracy.\n\nOriginally I addressed this by scoring the handle of my spork to mark 1, 2, and 3 cups measured in the pot -- an idea which I think originally came to me from somewhere on the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/">BackpackingLight</a> Forums. This method works ok -- though making the marks deep enough to be visible on the titanium was a bit tough with my knife -- but I\'ve never felt that it is very accurate. It will tell me if I have roughly 1 cup of water in the pot, but I could really be anywhere between 3/4 of a cup to 1 1/4 cups. That\'s the difference between nice, fluffy couscous and overly soggy (or dry and undercooked) couscous, you know.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630611286/" title="Pot and Spork by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3380/4630611286_8edfa28fef.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pot and Spork" /></a>\n\nAs a more accurate replacement, I came up with the idea for the Water Measuring Doohicky: a piece of paper with marks on it. Ingenious, isn\'t it?\n\nFor the paper, I chose a cut a piece out of a page in one of my <a href="http://www.riteintherain.com/">Rite in the Rain</a> notebooks. Then I put 1/2 cup of water into the pot, set in the paper, noted the water line, took out the paper and marked the water line. This was repeated at 1/2 cup increments up to 3 cups. (The pot holds 4 cups when filled to the rim, so 3 cups is the most I would ever want to cook with.) After I had all the marks determined, I cut an identical piece of paper and put marks at the same levels. Then I tossed the soggy paper and was left with a fresh, dry piece of waterproof paper with the appropriate marks.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630613254/" title="Water Measuring Doohickey by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4630613254_c486c79f6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Water Measuring Doohickey" /></a>\n\nAs a poor-man\'s lamination, I wrapped it with clear packing tape. Even though the Rite in the Rain paper is waterproof, it gets a little soggy when submerged and takes a while to dry out. Water doesn\'t cling to the tape at all. I can give it a shake or two after taking it out of the pot and it is immediately dry. The tape also adds a little stiffness, which helps achieve more accurate measurements.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630013187/" title="Water Measuring Doohickey by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4630013187_799149ee30_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Water Measuring Doohickey" class="right" /></a>\n\nI made two of these doohickeys at the same time, but have been using only one since last Fall. It works great. I am somewhat embarrassed it took me almost a year to come up with the idea. Even though I only made marks at 1/2 cup increments, the grid on the paper allows me to easily measure with 1/4 cup accuracy. As opposed to the marks on the spork, this paper is one extra thing to carry, but when placed on my scale it doesn\'t register. I don\'t think it weighs me down any.\n\nI had done the lamination before I thought of this, but next time around I think I will write common cooking ratios on the back: water to couscous, water to dehydrated brown rice, etc. Usually I write those ratios on the ziploc freezer bags that hold my food, but the bags get replaced and rotated fairly frequently. The Water Measuring Doohickey has proved that it will last for a longer period of time.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630616058/" title="Water Measuring Doohickey by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4630616058_56803713af.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Water Measuring Doohickey" /></a>'

Ingenious, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>For the paper, I chose a cut a piece out of a page in one of my <a href="http://www.riteintherain.com/">Rite in the Rain</a> notebooks. Then I put 1/2 cup of water into the pot, set in the paper, noted the water line, took out the paper and marked the water line. This was repeated at 1/2 cup increments up to 3 cups. (The pot holds 4 cups when filled to the rim, so 3 cups is the most I would ever want to cook with.) After I had all the marks determined, I cut an identical piece of paper and put marks at the same levels. Then I tossed the soggy paper and was left with a fresh, dry piece of waterproof paper with the appropriate marks.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630613254/" title="Water Measuring Doohickey by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4630613254_c486c79f6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Water Measuring Doohickey" /></a></p>\n<p>As a poor-man&#8217;s lamination, I wrapped it with clear packing tape. Even though the Rite in the Rain paper is waterproof, it gets a little soggy when submerged and takes a while to dry out. Water doesn&#8217;t cling to the tape at all. I can give it a shake or two after taking it out of the pot and it is immediately dry. The tape also adds a little stiffness, which helps achieve more accurate measurements.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630013187/" title="Water Measuring Doohickey by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4630013187_799149ee30_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Water Measuring Doohickey" class="right" /></a></p>\n<p>I made two of these doohickeys at the same time, but have been using only one since last Fall. It works great. I am somewhat embarrassed it took me almost a year to come up with the idea. Even though I only made marks at 1/2 cup increments, the grid on the paper allows me to easily measure with 1/4 cup accuracy. As opposed to the marks on the spork, this paper is one extra thing to carry, but when placed on my scale it doesn&#8217;t register. I don&#8217;t think it weighs me down any.</p>\n<p>I had done the lamination before I thought of this, but next time around I think I will write common cooking ratios on the back: water to couscous, water to dehydrated brown rice, etc. Usually I write those ratios on the ziploc freezer bags that hold my food, but the bags get replaced and rotated fairly frequently. The Water Measuring Doohickey has proved that it will last for a longer period of time.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4630616058/" title="Water Measuring Doohickey by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4630616058_56803713af.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Water Measuring Doohickey" /></a></p>'

My favorite bottle is still the old 40oz Klean Kanteen that I keep in my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">EDC bag</a>, but I\'ve been wanting something a bit skinnier that could fit in the bottle cage on my bike. I also was looking for an excuse to try out one of the newfangled wide mouth Klean Kanteens. I prefer a wide mouth opening on my bottles, but my 40oz Klean Kanteen (despite being beat on fairly heavily for the past few years) is in too good a shape to justify replacing it with a 40oz wide mouth. A new 27oz wide mouth bottle that would fit on my bike (not to mention in most car cup holders) and so supplement the 40oz bottle was easier to talk myself into!\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622252479/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4622252479_222665b322.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nTo go along with the wide mouth bottle, I also purchased a <a href="http://www.humangear.com/capCAP.html">humangear capCAP</a>. This product of questionable capitalization addresses the same problem as Guyot Design\'s <a href="http://www.guyotdesigns.com/category.php?id_category=5">Splashguard</a>: how to drink from a wide mouth bottle while moving without ending up with half the bottle\'s contents on your face and the other half up your nose. The capCAP allows the user to take advantage of the wide mouth for filling and cleaning (as well as water filter integration), but also provides a smaller opening for drinking.\n\nThe wider cap has indentations on it making it easy to grab and turn. The smaller cap, in addition to the indentations of the larger cap, is made of rubber, which makes for an easy grip while wearing gloves. The rubber has a tendency to pick up small amounts of dirt and sand, but so far I have not found this to be an annoyance.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622254237/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4622254237_53b2797efc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a>\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622866988/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1168/4622866988_21ff449104_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622258231/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3397/4622258231_bfa7f341d8_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\nMy habit in unscrewing bottle lids is to hold the body of the bottle in my left hand and unscrew the lid with my right. The problem with doing this with the capCAP is that attempting to unscrew the small lid tends to start to loosen the larger lid as well. All that\'s needed to rectify this is to hold the larger cap in my left hand rather than the body of the bottle itself. This forces a change of habit, which took me a couple weeks to get used to, but I now grab the larger cap with my left hand while unscrewing the smaller cap without thinking. I haven\'t had a problem with it since.\n\nWhen using the capCAP with my wide mouth Klean Kanteen, I find that it does leak slightly. If the bottle lays down on its side for a bit, a couple drops of water will escape from underneath the larger cap. The threads on the bottle\'s lip must not match up perfectly with those on the capCAP. If the bottle was to be thrown loosely into the body of the pack where it could shift around and potentially get a drop or two on some form of paper, I would opt for the more secure closure of the standard Klean Kanteen lid. But when the bottle is in the cage on my bike or stored upright in a pouch on my pack\'s waist belt, this small leak is no problem.\n\nThe capCAP can of course be used on other wide mouth bottles. I also use it on my <a href="http://www.nalgene-outdoor.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=59">32oz HDPE Nalgene</a> as well as my <a href="http://www.guyotdesigns.com/product.php?id_product=87">32oz Guyot Designs Backpacker</a> and have not noticed any leaking with those bottles. It\'s a pretty neat product that I think makes a great addition to any wide mouth bottle.\n\nHere are the weights of various lids, measured on my scale:\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><a href="http://www.humangear.com/capCAP.html">humangear capCAP</a></dt>\n\t<dd>1.3oz</dd>\n\t<dt><a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/accessories/klean-kanteen-caps-wide-loop.html">Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Loop Cap</a></dt>\n\t<dd>2.2oz</dd>\n\t<dt>Guyot Designs lid</dt>\n\t<dd>2.2oz</dd>\n\t<dt>Standard Nalgene lid</dt>\n\t<dd>0.6oz</dd>\n</dl>'

A new 27oz wide mouth bottle that would fit on my bike (not to mention in most car cup holders) and so supplement the 40oz bottle was easier to talk myself into!</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622252479/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4622252479_222665b322.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a>\n<!--more--></p>\n<p>To go along with the wide mouth bottle, I also purchased a <a href="http://www.humangear.com/capCAP.html">humangear capCAP</a>. This product of questionable capitalization addresses the same problem as Guyot Design&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guyotdesigns.com/category.php?id_category=5">Splashguard</a>: how to drink from a wide mouth bottle while moving without ending up with half the bottle&#8217;s contents on your face and the other half up your nose. The capCAP allows the user to take advantage of the wide mouth for filling and cleaning (as well as water filter integration), but also provides a smaller opening for drinking.</p>\n<p>The wider cap has indentations on it making it easy to grab and turn. The smaller cap, in addition to the indentations of the larger cap, is made of rubber, which makes for an easy grip while wearing gloves. The rubber has a tendency to pick up small amounts of dirt and sand, but so far I have not found this to be an annoyance.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622254237/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4622254237_53b2797efc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622866988/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1168/4622866988_21ff449104_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4622258231/" title="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3397/4622258231_bfa7f341d8_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="humangear capCAP on a Klean Kanteen" /></a></li>\n</ul></p>\n<p>My habit in unscrewing bottle lids is to hold the body of the bottle in my left hand and unscrew the lid with my right. The problem with doing this with the capCAP is that attempting to unscrew the small lid tends to start to loosen the larger lid as well. All that&#8217;s needed to rectify this is to hold the larger cap in my left hand rather than the body of the bottle itself. This forces a change of habit, which took me a couple weeks to get used to, but I now grab the larger cap with my left hand while unscrewing the smaller cap without thinking. I haven&#8217;t had a problem with it since.</p>\n<p>When using the capCAP with my wide mouth Klean Kanteen, I find that it does leak slightly. If the bottle lays down on its side for a bit, a couple drops of water will escape from underneath the larger cap. The threads on the bottle&#8217;s lip must not match up perfectly with those on the capCAP. If the bottle was to be thrown loosely into the body of the pack where it could shift around and potentially get a drop or two on some form of paper, I would opt for the more secure closure of the standard Klean Kanteen lid. But when the bottle is in the cage on my bike or stored upright in a pouch on my pack&#8217;s waist belt, this small leak is no problem.</p>\n<p>The capCAP can of course be used on other wide mouth bottles. I also use it on my <a href="http://www.nalgene-outdoor.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=59">32oz HDPE Nalgene</a> as well as my <a href="http://www.guyotdesigns.com/product.php?id_product=87">32oz Guyot Designs Backpacker</a> and have not noticed any leaking with those bottles. It&#8217;s a pretty neat product that I think makes a great addition to any wide mouth bottle.</p>\n<p>Here are the weights of various lids, measured on my scale:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><a href="http://www.humangear.com/capCAP.html">humangear capCAP</a></dt>\n<dd>1.3oz</dd>\n<dt><a href="http://www.kleankanteen.com/products/accessories/klean-kanteen-caps-wide-loop.html">Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Loop Cap</a></dt>\n<dd>2.2oz</dd>\n<dt>Guyot Designs lid</dt>\n<dd>2.2oz</dd>\n<dt>Standard Nalgene lid</dt>\n<dd>0.6oz</dd>\n</dl>'

    vellum_post_73.body = u'My last trekking poles were a pair of <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/756152">REI Peak UL Carbon Compacts</a>. I was quite fond of them. At 11 oz for the pair, they were one of the lightest pair of telescoping poles available. Sadly, I broke them last January. A lot of folks who have only used aluminium poles cast a critical eye on those made of carbon fiber, thinking them flimsy and weak, so I think it is important to point out that it was a piece of the <em>plastic locking mechanism</em> that broke, not the carbon fiber pole shafts. I think that carbon fiber is a perfectly adequate material for trekking poles and should stand up to all reasonable abuse.\n\nWhen my old poles broke, I took them into REI hoping that there might be some way to repair them. We spent an hour or so going through all their spare parts and trying to hack something usable back together, but in the end we couldn\'t come to a solution that I was satisfied with. The fellow I\'d been talking with mentioned that he could give me credit for the broken poles, which surprised me. I\'ve returned plenty of used gear to REI, but never an item that was actually broken (and broken, as far as I\'m concerned, due to user error and not any fault in the product itself). I guess they\'re serious about that <a href="http://www.rei.com/help/guarantee.html">guarantee</a>.\n\nThe credit was certainly welcome. I took it, but now I had to decide what to replace the poles with. REI no longer makes the Peak UL Carbon Compact trekking poles, so I couldn\'t get another pair of the same. I started to look around to see what was on the market. My first limiting factor in the search was that I needed telescoping poles. I use trekking poles to pitch my <a href="http://kifaru.net/tarps_hootches.html">Kifaru Paratarp</a>. For the tarp, the needed height of the rear pole is 26". This rules out a lot of poles that only collapse to something closer to 30", such as those from <a href="http://www.titaniumgoat.com/poles.html">Titanium Goat</a> and <a href="http://gossamergear.com/trekking/lt4-trekking-poles.html">Gossamer Gear</a>. The other big factor was weight. Ideally, I wished to stay as close as possible to the 11 oz weight of the old poles. A quick look around told me that I would have to come to terms with at least some weight gain, as there didn\'t seem to be anything to compete with the weight of the Peak UL Carbon Compacts. Some poles weighed 20 oz or more for the pair, which was just ridiculous! <a href="http://www.leki.com/">Leki</a> had a few poles in the 14-16 oz neighborhood. A decent weight, I thought, but none of the poles really jumped out at me.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nEventually I came upon the offerings from <a href="http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com">Black Diamond</a>. Their poles use the FlickLock locking mechanism, which I had heard of before. It had always intrigued me but I\'d been turned off by the extra weight associated with it. Most of the big names in trekking poles, like Leki and <a href="http://www.komperdell.com/">Komperdell</a> use a twist-lock mechanism which, as anybody who has ever used such poles can attest, is finicky at best. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:lekilock"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:lekilock" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>\n\nAfter a bit more research, I decided that the greater functionality of the FlickLock system would be worth the weight gain. I landed on the <a href="http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/trekking-poles/alpine-carbon-cork-trekking-pole/">Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork</a> trekking poles. At 17.5 oz they were a good deal heavier than my old poles, but I thought I would give them a chance.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4612660329/" title="Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork Trekking Poles by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4612660329_5634df7b99.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork Trekking Poles" /></a>\n\nAs the name implies the Alpine Carbon Cork poles have a cork handle and three shafts made of carbon fiber. They collapse down to 25" and expand to 51".\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613287502/" title="Three Piece Pole by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3579/4613287502_818edf3a7a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Three Piece Pole" /></a>\n\n<h2>FlickLock</h2>\n\nThe FlickLock mechanism operates as basically a clamp. When shut, it compresses the outer shaft, which prevents the inner shaft from moving. The tightness of the clamp can be adjusted with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4612650519/in/set-72157624074194180/">a single screw</a>. It is simple, effective, and works in all conditions. There is no messing around with twisting one shaft to expand some little doohickey that you can\'t see in the hopes that pressure will be built up against the inside of the outer shaft, no sitting around twisting one pole in the proper direction for 5 minutes wondering if the thing will ever lock, and there is little chance that shafts will accidentally collapse while in use. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:twistlock"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:twistlock" title="see footnote">2</a></sup> Beyond the fact that the FlickLock mechanism actually <em>works</em> on a reliable basis, the next advantage is the speed of use: flick it open, adjust, and flick it closed. The main idea behind adjustable poles is that you can alter the length to meet the terrain: make the poles shorter for going uphill, longer for going downhill. With my previous twist-lock poles, I never did this. I only set the length once before setting out for the day. Periodically adjusting the poles was too risky (there was a likely chance I\'d unlock them to adjust and spend countless minutes trying to get them to lock again) and even if I could be assured that the locking mechanism would work it still took a few seconds longer than I liked. Now with the FlickLock poles, I find myself merrily adjusting the poles to suit the terrain all day.\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613260516/" title="FlickLock Open by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3369/4613260516_1e35bca49c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="FlickLock Open" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613263348/" title="FlickLock Closed by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4613263348_cc20835dd8_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="FlickLock Closed" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613289268/" title="FlickLock Closed by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/4613289268_e644b0df8d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="FlickLock Closed" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Baskets</h2>\n\nAs with any decent trekking poles, the Alpine Carbon Corks come with both dirt and snow baskets. The snow baskets are nothing special, but I was surprised at how small the dirt baskets were. I\'m not sure why they chose to make the baskets with so small a diameter. So far I have no noticed no difference in how they work. I\'m probably not the best judge of that though, as I find all kinds of baskets to be unnecessary when there isn\'t any snow. (I had a habit of losing baskets with all my old poles, but since I noticed no difference without the baskets I never spent the money to replace them.)\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613249694/" title="Baskets by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3405/4613249694_8ba9b942a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Baskets" /></a>\n\nRather than just sliding on the pole and being secured with a nipple and indentation, the baskets on the Black Diamond poles are actually threaded. You slide them on and then screw them down over the threaded area. This seems like a much more secure system. I think it unlikely that I\'ll inadvertently loose these baskets.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4612639785/" title="Dirt Basket Installed by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4612639785_7e7f89c53c.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Dirt Basket Installed" /></a>\n\n<h2>Handles</h2>\n\nThe cork handles on these poles are new to me. My previous poles have always had foam handles. I\'ve heard claims that cork handles are more comfortable than foam, but so far I have noticed no difference in that department. Still, I have only had these poles for the cooler part of the year. Perhaps in the summer heat with sweaty palms I will appreciate more of a difference. I am curious to see if there is much difference in the durability of the cork. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613292332/in/set-72157624074194180/">I\'ve already had a couple small pieces chip off</a> -- not enough to raise too much concern, but I\'ll keep an eye on it.\n\nThe ergonomic shape of the handle is fine, but I don\'t use it much. Rather than grasping the poles properly, my preferred method of use for trekking poles has always been to rest my wrist in the strap and lightly hold the lower part of the handle in the fleshy part of my hand between thumb and forefinger. I don\'t think this is the most efficient way of doing things -- placing all the weight on the wrist doesn\'t seem the best thing to do -- but it has always been most comfortable and natural to me. It allows me to freely swing the pole back and forth as I walk without much movement of the arm. (I say <em>pole</em>, not <em>poles</em> because though I always carry two to setup my tarp, I rarely hike with more than one pole. I like to have one hand free and find two poles cumbersome and unnecessary except for going down the steepest of hills.)\n\nBelow the cork handle, the upper part of the shaft has a foam grip, which I appreciate it. My old REI UL Carbon Compact poles lacked this (because of the extra weight it would entail, no doubt) and I found that I missed the feature. It\'s nice to have a comfortable spot to grip when you are climbing up a short steep hill and don\'t want to adjust the length of the poles.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613281882/" title="Cork Handles and Foam Grip by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4613281882_ecc921f251.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cork Handles and Foam Grip" /></a>\n\n<h2>StickPic</h2>\n\nOf course, with a new pair of poles I needed a new <a href="http://thestickpic.com/">StickPic</a>. My <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/01/06/the-new-stickpic/">old models</a> wouldn\'t fit on the tip of the Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Corks. I tried to buy a new one, but Rodney Java refunded my money. That\'s three now he\'s given me for free. Someday I\'ll track him down and shove the money under his door.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613277426/" title="StickPic #3 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4613277426_b2d3feef1c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="StickPic #3" /></a>\n\n<h2>Impressions</h2>\n\nI\'ve been using the Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork for about 4 months now and they have exceeded my expectations. I was wary at first about not getting a return for the significant increase in weight. Of course I still would <em>like</em> them to be lighter, but I feel that the increased functionality has justified the increased weight.  <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:weight"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:weight" title="see footnote">3</a></sup> I am very pleased with the poles.\n\n<div id="footnotes">\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li id="fn:lekilock"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:lekilock" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> I had heard that Leki would be releasing a line of poles this spring using a new external locking mechanism similar to Black Diamond\'s FlickLock. They since have, and call it the SpeedLock, but this was back in winter and I couldn\'t wait the few months till the release. I haven\'t seen the new SpeedLock in person yet. It sounds like a good replacement of the old twist-lock system, but I\'m not sure how it stacks up against Black Diamond\'s FlickLock. The closest Leki poles to compare with the Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Corks seem to be the <a href="http://www.leki.com/trekking/trekkingPole.php?pID=26">Corklite Aergons</a>.</li>\n\t<li id="fn:twistlock"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:twistlock" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> Ok, ok, the twist-lock isn\'t really that bad.

There is no messing around with twisting one shaft to expand some little doohickey that you can&#8217;t see in the hopes that pressure will be built up against the inside of the outer shaft, no sitting around twisting one pole in the proper direction for 5 minutes wondering if the thing will ever lock, and there is little chance that shafts will accidentally collapse while in use. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:twistlock"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:twistlock" title="see footnote">2</a></sup> Beyond the fact that the FlickLock mechanism actually <em>works</em> on a reliable basis, the next advantage is the speed of use: flick it open, adjust, and flick it closed. The main idea behind adjustable poles is that you can alter the length to meet the terrain: make the poles shorter for going uphill, longer for going downhill. With my previous twist-lock poles, I never did this. I only set the length once before setting out for the day. Periodically adjusting the poles was too risky (there was a likely chance I&#8217;d unlock them to adjust and spend countless minutes trying to get them to lock again) and even if I could be assured that the locking mechanism would work it still took a few seconds longer than I liked. Now with the FlickLock poles, I find myself merrily adjusting the poles to suit the terrain all day.</p>\n<ul class="thumbs">\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613260516/" title="FlickLock Open by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3369/4613260516_1e35bca49c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="FlickLock Open" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613263348/" title="FlickLock Closed by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4613263348_cc20835dd8_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="FlickLock Closed" /></a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613289268/" title="FlickLock Closed by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/4613289268_e644b0df8d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="FlickLock Closed" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Baskets</h2>\n\n<p>As with any decent trekking poles, the Alpine Carbon Corks come with both dirt and snow baskets. The snow baskets are nothing special, but I was surprised at how small the dirt baskets were. I&#8217;m not sure why they chose to make the baskets with so small a diameter. So far I have no noticed no difference in how they work. I&#8217;m probably not the best judge of that though, as I find all kinds of baskets to be unnecessary when there isn&#8217;t any snow. (I had a habit of losing baskets with all my old poles, but since I noticed no difference without the baskets I never spent the money to replace them.)</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613249694/" title="Baskets by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3405/4613249694_8ba9b942a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Baskets" /></a></p>\n<p>Rather than just sliding on the pole and being secured with a nipple and indentation, the baskets on the Black Diamond poles are actually threaded. You slide them on and then screw them down over the threaded area. This seems like a much more secure system. I think it unlikely that I&#8217;ll inadvertently loose these baskets.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4612639785/" title="Dirt Basket Installed by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4612639785_7e7f89c53c.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Dirt Basket Installed" /></a>\n<h2>Handles</h2></p>\n<p>The cork handles on these poles are new to me. My previous poles have always had foam handles. I&#8217;ve heard claims that cork handles are more comfortable than foam, but so far I have noticed no difference in that department. Still, I have only had these poles for the cooler part of the year. Perhaps in the summer heat with sweaty palms I will appreciate more of a difference. I am curious to see if there is much difference in the durability of the cork. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613292332/in/set-72157624074194180/">I&#8217;ve already had a couple small pieces chip off</a> &#8212; not enough to raise too much concern, but I&#8217;ll keep an eye on it.</p>\n<p>The ergonomic shape of the handle is fine, but I don&#8217;t use it much. Rather than grasping the poles properly, my preferred method of use for trekking poles has always been to rest my wrist in the strap and lightly hold the lower part of the handle in the fleshy part of my hand between thumb and forefinger. I don&#8217;t think this is the most efficient way of doing things &#8212; placing all the weight on the wrist doesn&#8217;t seem the best thing to do &#8212; but it has always been most comfortable and natural to me. It allows me to freely swing the pole back and forth as I walk without much movement of the arm. (I say <em>pole</em>, not <em>poles</em> because though I always carry two to setup my tarp, I rarely hike with more than one pole. I like to have one hand free and find two poles cumbersome and unnecessary except for going down the steepest of hills.)</p>\n<p>Below the cork handle, the upper part of the shaft has a foam grip, which I appreciate it. My old REI UL Carbon Compact poles lacked this (because of the extra weight it would entail, no doubt) and I found that I missed the feature. It&#8217;s nice to have a comfortable spot to grip when you are climbing up a short steep hill and don&#8217;t want to adjust the length of the poles.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613281882/" title="Cork Handles and Foam Grip by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4613281882_ecc921f251.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cork Handles and Foam Grip" /></a>\n<h2>StickPic</h2></p>\n<p>Of course, with a new pair of poles I needed a new <a href="http://thestickpic.com/">StickPic</a>. My <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/01/06/the-new-stickpic/">old models</a> wouldn&#8217;t fit on the tip of the Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Corks. I tried to buy a new one, but Rodney Java refunded my money. That&#8217;s three now he&#8217;s given me for free. Someday I&#8217;ll track him down and shove the money under his door.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4613277426/" title="StickPic #3 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4613277426_b2d3feef1c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="StickPic #3" /></a>\n<h2>Impressions</h2></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using the Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork for about 4 months now and they have exceeded my expectations. I was wary at first about not getting a return for the significant increase in weight. Of course I still would <em>like</em> them to be lighter, but I feel that the increased functionality has justified the increased weight.  <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:weight"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:weight" title="see footnote">3</a></sup> I am very pleased with the poles.</p>\n<div id="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:lekilock"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:lekilock" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> I had heard that Leki would be releasing a line of poles this spring using a new external locking mechanism similar to Black Diamond&#8217;s FlickLock. They since have, and call it the SpeedLock, but this was back in winter and I couldn&#8217;t wait the few months till the release. I haven&#8217;t seen the new SpeedLock in person yet. It sounds like a good replacement of the old twist-lock system, but I&#8217;m not sure how it stacks up against Black Diamond&#8217;s FlickLock. The closest Leki poles to compare with the Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Corks seem to be the <a href="http://www.leki.com/trekking/trekkingPole.php?pID=26">Corklite Aergons</a>.</li>\n<li id="fn:twistlock"><a rev="footnote" href="#fnref:twistlock" class="footnote-return" title="return to article">&crarr;</a> Ok, ok, the twist-lock isn&#8217;t really that bad.

    vellum_post_78.body = u'It\'s been nearly two years since I last redesigned this site. Don\'t let me go that long again! The web is supposed to be a dynamic place, you know. Anyway, here\'s the new look.\n\nIt isn\'t drastically different from the old one. I\'m still keeping it clean and simple, and the base colors are the same.\n\nYou might notice the rounded corners on some things. Yeah, that\'s right. Web 2.0, here I come! I think rounded corners are only acceptable if accomplished with simple CSS. CSS3 is slated to include the <code>border-radius</code> property to achieve rounded corners. The specifications are not yet finalized, but Mozilla browsers have implemented the property with <code>-moz-border-radius</code> and WebKit browsers with <code>-webkit-border-radius</code>. Those are the properties that I\'m using. That means you\'ll get rounded corners in browsers like Firefox and Safari. Opera seems to work too. Internet Explorer, not so much. (Come on, IE has a hard enough time complying with <em>current</em> standards. You can\'t expect it to look to the future!)\n\nIf you notice any bugs or would like to suggest any changes, let me know. After all, the site is really for you, dear user.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n(I did briefly look at everything on a Windows box running IE8. It seemed to work -- other than the rounded corners, of course -- but if you notice any bugs in that particular browser, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/switch.html">you know the drill</a>.)\n\nTwo of the things that really spurred this design are <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/share/readability2.html">Clippable</a>. For about a month now, I\'ve been using these bookmarklets while reading longs articles online. They help a lot. But it\'s really a problem with the design of some sites that I feel the need to use them. I decided that I wanted to redesign my site with <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/typography/">typography</a> in mind.\n\nI\'m also now integrating Twitter posts into the blog. We\'ll see how that goes. They\'re styled differently, so there is a visual distinction between a tweet and a normal post. The idea is that I\'m now just using twitter as a back-end to create short posts. If I want to, I can switch to some other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a> service and you, the user, need never know the difference. (I could even just use Wordpress to create short posts! But that might get me kicked off the interwebs...)\n\nTweets integrated into the blog means tweets in the RSS feed, as well. That makes my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/10/01/rss-mash-up/">RSS mash-up</a> a bit irrelevant. If you currently subscribe to that, I\'d recommend changing your subscription back to <a href="/feed/">the normal feed</a>. For those who don\'t want to change, I\'ve removed the Twitter feed from the mash-up\'s input. That way you won\'t have to read each of my tweets twice. The mash-up feed will now only include the blog and Flickr stream.\n\n<h2>Blueprint</h2>\n\nThis design is built upon the <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> CSS framework. I\'ve used it a handful of times before, but never properly. My method was always to link to the three Blueprint CSS files (<code>screen.css</code>, <code>print.css</code>, and <code>ie.css</code>) in the header and then toss in a link to my own stylesheet underneath them. I never used the <a href="http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/blob/master/lib/compress.rb">compressor</a>.\n\nThe idea behind the compressor is pretty simple. It allows you to maintain one central instance of Blueprint and use that to generate the CSS needed for each individual project. \n\nThe <a href="http://jdclayton.com/blueprints_compress_a_walkthrough.html">author\'s walk through</a> outlines the general idea:\n\n    \t<ul>\n    \t<li>Keep a core Blueprint folder checked out with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> on your computer</li>\n    \t\t<li>Create a settings.yml file within the Blueprint folder with all the specifics of each project using Blueprint</li>\n    \t\t<li>Use the command line to generate <span class="caps">CSS</span> for a project on command\n    \t<ul>\n    \t<li>Incorporating any site-specific attributes\n    \t<ul>\n    \t<li>Namespace on all Blueprint classes</li>\n    \t\t<li>Custom grid template rather than the standard 24 columns / 30px column width / 10px gutter width</li>\n    \t</ul>\n    \t</li>\n    \t\t<li>Compressing any custom <span class="caps">CSS</span> and appending to the end of the Blueprint stylesheets</li>\n    \t\t<li>Appending custom semantic selectors to the end of the Blueprint stylesheets</li>\n    \t</ul></li>\n    \t</ul>\n\nWhen I first head about this, I though that the compression bit was all well and good, but I\'ve never been really adamant about optimizing CSS for speed in the first place. I\'m more concerned about compliance with standards and readability. Maintaining a central Blueprint instance didn\'t appeal to me much, either. What really stood out is the ability to have custom semantic selectors.\n\nCSS frameworks are neat. I\'ve used a handful. Like any other tool, they\'re not always appropriate. When they are, they have certain advantages and disadvantages. One of the main things that I dislike about them is that they encourage you to clutter your code with framework-specific junk. If you\'re using <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a> you\'re going to have elements with classes like "container_x", "grid_x", "omega", and "suffix_x" all over the place. With <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">Grids</a> you\'ll have "yui-g", "yui-b", "yui-main", and the like. Readability of code is diminished and you\'ll probably end up suffering from a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div#Overuse">div-itis</a>. Not to mention, you can forget about a strict separation of markup and styling. Sure, you <em>could</em> copy the style definitions for the specific framework classes into the classes or IDs of your own elements, but how many folks actually take the time to do all that copying and pasting? I sure don\'t! The appeal in a CSS framework is to save time, not make the process of building a site longer. Plus, there\'s an appeal in having the framework-related styling separate from the normal site styling. Such a separation makes the framework easy to update.\n\nThis is where Blueprint\'s semantic classes comes in. It allows you to tell Blueprint to take one of your classes (or IDs) and apply to it the properties of one of Blueprint\'s classes. A-mazing.\n\nAs an example, the header of this page might look something like this if built on Blueprint without the compressor:\n<pre>\n<div id="top" class="span-24 last">\n\t<ul id="nav" class="span-18 prepend-1">\n\t\t<li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href="#">Who</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href="#">What</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href="#">Connections</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<form method="get" id="search" class="span-5 last" action="...">\n        <input type="text" id="search-box" value="Search" name="s" />\n    </form>\n</div>\n\n<h1 id="title" class="span-24 last">pig-monkey.com</h1>\n<p id="description" class="span-23 prepend-1 last">Blah blah blah...</p>\n\n<ul id="flickr" class="span-20 append-2 prepend-2 last">\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto2.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto3.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto4.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto5.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n</ul>\n</pre>\n\nLook at those framework-specific classes all over the place. Nasty. But in the Blueprint compressor settings file, I can define some semantic classes.\n<pre>\n"#top, h1#title" : "span-24 last"\n"#top #nav" : "span-18 prepend-1"\n"#top form#search" : "span-5 last"\n"#description" : "span-23 prepend-1 last"\n"#flickr" : "span-20 append-2 prepend-1 last"\n</pre>\n\nNow my markup looks like this:\n<pre>\n<div id="top">\n\t<ul id="nav">\n\t\t<li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href="#">Who</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href="#">What</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href="#">Connections</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<form method="get" id="search" action="...">\n        <input type="text" id="search-box" value="Search" name="s" />\n    </form>\n</div>\n\n<h1 id="title">pig-monkey.com</h1>\n<p id="description">Blah blah blah...</p>\n\n<ul id="flickr">\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto2.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto3.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto4.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n\t<li><img src="myawesomephoto5.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n</ul>\n</pre>\n\nClean as a whistle! No useless <code>div</code>s, all elements semantically named, and not dependent on any framework.\n\nAs great as the compressor is, I do have a couple problems with it. When using the compressor, Blueprint intends that you only have 3 final (compressed) stylesheets: <code>screen.css</code>, <code>print.css</code>, and <code>ie.css</code>. Wordpress, of course, requires a <code>style.css</code> file to define the template. That\'s no problem. I just a create a <code>style.css</code> file that has the theme information in it and then toss in a <code>@import url(\'blueprint/screen.css\')</code>. Then in the Wordpress header I can put a link to <code>style.css</code>, <code>print.css</code>, and <code>ie.css</code>. Everybody\'s happy.\n\nStyling a website basically boils down to making a small change to the stylesheet and refreshing the page to see how that looks. Running the compressor after each change to combine the custom stylesheet with the <code>screen.css</code> file is not productive. So for the development process I tossed a <code>@import url(\'blueprint/custom.css\')</code> into the main <code>style.css</code> file. That works fine.\n\nThen I finish building the theme. I\'m ready to compress the stylesheets, so I remove the call to the custom stylesheet in <code>style.css</code>. I tell the compressor where the custom stylesheet is and have it combine it with the <code>screen.css</code> file. I run the compressor, reload the site, and everything explodes.\n\nJust when I thought I was done!\n\nThe problem is that in the stylesheet the compressor generates, it puts my custom styles above the semantic classes. Throughout the development process, I was calling the <code>screen.css</code> file (which includes the semantic classes) <em>before</em> the custom stylesheet. As you no doubt know, stylesheets <em>cascade</em>. You can\'t just switch up the order of elements without breaking stuff.\n\nOh well, I thought. At this point I was tired working on the site and didn\'t care enough to fight it. I just put the line to call the custom sheet back in <code>style.css</code> after Blueprint\'s <code>screen.css</code> file. I still feel like the whole semantic classes bit is enough of a reason to use the compressor, even if I\'m not actually compressing my main stylesheet!'

I think rounded corners are only acceptable if accomplished with simple CSS. CSS3 is slated to include the <code>border-radius</code> property to achieve rounded corners. The specifications are not yet finalized, but Mozilla browsers have implemented the property with <code>-moz-border-radius</code> and WebKit browsers with <code>-webkit-border-radius</code>. Those are the properties that I&#8217;m using. That means you&#8217;ll get rounded corners in browsers like Firefox and Safari. Opera seems to work too. Internet Explorer, not so much. (Come on, IE has a hard enough time complying with <em>current</em> standards. You can&#8217;t expect it to look to the future!)</p>\n<p>If you notice any bugs or would like to suggest any changes, let me know. After all, the site is really for you, dear user.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>(I did briefly look at everything on a Windows box running IE8. It seemed to work &#8212; other than the rounded corners, of course &#8212; but if you notice any bugs in that particular browser, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/switch.html">you know the drill</a>.)</p>\n<p>Two of the things that really spurred this design are <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/share/readability2.html">Clippable</a>. For about a month now, I&#8217;ve been using these bookmarklets while reading longs articles online. They help a lot. But it&#8217;s really a problem with the design of some sites that I feel the need to use them. I decided that I wanted to redesign my site with <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/topics/design/typography/">typography</a> in mind.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also now integrating Twitter posts into the blog. We&#8217;ll see how that goes. They&#8217;re styled differently, so there is a visual distinction between a tweet and a normal post. The idea is that I&#8217;m now just using twitter as a back-end to create short posts. If I want to, I can switch to some other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a> service and you, the user, need never know the difference. (I could even just use Wordpress to create short posts! But that might get me kicked off the interwebs&#8230;)</p>\n<p>Tweets integrated into the blog means tweets in the RSS feed, as well. That makes my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/10/01/rss-mash-up/">RSS mash-up</a> a bit irrelevant. If you currently subscribe to that, I&#8217;d recommend changing your subscription back to <a href="/feed/">the normal feed</a>. For those who don&#8217;t want to change, I&#8217;ve removed the Twitter feed from the mash-up&#8217;s input. That way you won&#8217;t have to read each of my tweets twice. The mash-up feed will now only include the blog and Flickr stream.</p>\n<h2>Blueprint</h2>\n\n<p>This design is built upon the <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> CSS framework. I&#8217;ve used it a handful of times before, but never properly. My method was always to link to the three Blueprint CSS files (<code>screen.css</code>, <code>print.css</code>, and <code>ie.css</code>) in the header and then toss in a link to my own stylesheet underneath them. I never used the <a href="http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/blob/master/lib/compress.rb">compressor</a>.</p>\n<p>The idea behind the compressor is pretty simple. It allows you to maintain one central instance of Blueprint and use that to generate the CSS needed for each individual project. </p>\n<p>The <a href="http://jdclayton.com/blueprints_compress_a_walkthrough.html">author&#8217;s walk through</a> outlines the general idea:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="o">&</span><span class="ow">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">ul</span><span class="o">&</span><span class="ow">gt</span><span class="p">;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p><li>Keep a core Blueprint folder checked out with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> on your computer</li>\n<li>Create a settings.yml file within the Blueprint folder with all the specifics of each project using Blueprint</li>\n<li>Use the command line to generate <span class="caps">CSS</span> for a project on command\n        </li></ul><ul>\n<li>Incorporating any site-specific attributes\n        </li></ul><ul>\n<li>Namespace on all Blueprint classes</li>\n<li>Custom grid template rather than the standard 24 columns / 30px column width / 10px gutter width</li>\n</ul></p>\n<li>Compressing any custom <span class="caps">CSS</span> and appending to the end of the Blueprint stylesheets</li>\n<li>Appending custom semantic selectors to the end of the Blueprint stylesheets</li>\n\n<p>When I first head about this, I though that the compression bit was all well and good, but I&#8217;ve never been really adamant about optimizing CSS for speed in the first place. I&#8217;m more concerned about compliance with standards and readability. Maintaining a central Blueprint instance didn&#8217;t appeal to me much, either. What really stood out is the ability to have custom semantic selectors.</p>\n<p>CSS frameworks are neat. I&#8217;ve used a handful. Like any other tool, they&#8217;re not always appropriate. When they are, they have certain advantages and disadvantages. One of the main things that I dislike about them is that they encourage you to clutter your code with framework-specific junk. If you&#8217;re using <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a> you&#8217;re going to have elements with classes like &#8220;container_x&#8221;, &#8220;grid_x&#8221;, &#8220;omega&#8221;, and &#8220;suffix_x&#8221; all over the place. With <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">Grids</a> you&#8217;ll have &#8220;yui-g&#8221;, &#8220;yui-b&#8221;, &#8220;yui-main&#8221;, and the like. Readability of code is diminished and you&#8217;ll probably end up suffering from a case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div#Overuse">div-itis</a>. Not to mention, you can forget about a strict separation of markup and styling. Sure, you <em>could</em> copy the style definitions for the specific framework classes into the classes or IDs of your own elements, but how many folks actually take the time to do all that copying and pasting? I sure don&#8217;t! The appeal in a CSS framework is to save time, not make the process of building a site longer. Plus, there&#8217;s an appeal in having the framework-related styling separate from the normal site styling. Such a separation makes the framework easy to update.</p>\n<p>This is where Blueprint&#8217;s semantic classes comes in. It allows you to tell Blueprint to take one of your classes (or IDs) and apply to it the properties of one of Blueprint&#8217;s classes. A-mazing.</p>\n<p>As an example, the header of this page might look something like this if built on Blueprint without the compressor:\n<pre>\n<div id="top" class="span-24 last">\n<ul id="nav" class="span-18 prepend-1">\n<li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href="#">Who</a></li>\n<li><a href="#">What</a></li>\n<li><a href="#">Connections</a></li>\n</ul>\n<form method="get" id="search" class="span-5 last" action="...">\n<input type="text" id="search-box" value="Search" name="s" />\n</form>\n</div>\n<h1 id="title" class="span-24 last">pig-monkey.com</h1>\n<p id="description" class="span-23 prepend-1 last">Blah blah blah...</p>\n<ul id="flickr" class="span-20 append-2 prepend-2 last">\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto2.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto3.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto4.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto5.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n</ul>\n</pre></p>\n<p>Look at those framework-specific classes all over the place. Nasty. But in the Blueprint compressor settings file, I can define some semantic classes.\n<pre>\n"#top, h1#title" : "span-24 last"\n"#top #nav" : "span-18 prepend-1"\n"#top form#search" : "span-5 last"\n"#description" : "span-23 prepend-1 last"\n"#flickr" : "span-20 append-2 prepend-1 last"\n</pre></p>\n<p>Now my markup looks like this:\n<pre>\n<div id="top">\n<ul id="nav">\n<li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href="#">Who</a></li>\n<li><a href="#">What</a></li>\n<li><a href="#">Connections</a></li>\n</ul>\n<form method="get" id="search" action="...">\n<input type="text" id="search-box" value="Search" name="s" />\n</form>\n</div>\n<h1 id="title">pig-monkey.com</h1>\n<p id="description">Blah blah blah...</p>\n<ul id="flickr">\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto2.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto3.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto4.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n<li><img src="myawesomephoto5.jpg" alt="My Awesome Photo" /></li>\n</ul>\n</pre></p>\n<p>Clean as a whistle! No useless <code>div</code>s, all elements semantically named, and not dependent on any framework.</p>\n<p>As great as the compressor is, I do have a couple problems with it. When using the compressor, Blueprint intends that you only have 3 final (compressed) stylesheets: <code>screen.css</code>, <code>print.css</code>, and <code>ie.css</code>. Wordpress, of course, requires a <code>style.css</code> file to define the template. That&#8217;s no problem. I just a create a <code>style.css</code> file that has the theme information in it and then toss in a <code>@import url(\'blueprint/screen.css\')</code>. Then in the Wordpress header I can put a link to <code>style.css</code>, <code>print.css</code>, and <code>ie.css</code>. Everybody&#8217;s happy.</p>\n<p>Styling a website basically boils down to making a small change to the stylesheet and refreshing the page to see how that looks.

I\'ve had three of their military hydration systems and never experienced a leak -- except once when I neglected to fully close the bladder\'s lid. In snowy, alpine conditions I would chuckle at others whose hydration hoses were frozen shut, while I confidently sucked on my insulated Camelbak hose. The Camelbak mouthpiece always insured a high flow-rate, unlike some other brands, and the hose could be shut off at either end, providing further protection against the accidental leaks that have been known to plague other bladders.\n\nBut the Camelbak\'s durability comes at a price. My 100oz Omega Reservoir (including bite valve and insulated tube) weigh in at 10oz. Not exactly light. So last year, I decided to give <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus">Platypus</a> bladders a shot. I had been critical of their toughness in the past, but their <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus/handheld-hydration/platy-bottle/product">2 liter bottle</a> weighed in at only 1.4oz. With optional <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus/platy-accessories/drink-tube-kit/product">drink tube kit</a> and <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus/platy-accessories/bite-valve-cover/product">bite valve cover</a>, the full system weighed 3.6oz. It had been referred to as the "gold standard" in ultralight bottles. Too enticing not to pick up.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nOf course, the low weight of the Platypus system also comes at a price. The small opening makes the bladder less convenient to fill. The tube is uninsulated, and so inappropriate for much cold weather use. The bite valve has a low flow rate and is prone to leaking. The bite valve cover is cumbersome and difficult to close. And the bladder itself is made of a much thinner and less durable plastic than the Camelbaks. Still, I have been very happy overall with the 2L Platypus bottle. I have not touched the Camelbak once since making the conversion.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4552775612/" title="Leaky Platypus by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3558/4552775612_c7eb804333.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Leaky Platypus" /></a>\n\nBut now my Platypus has begun to leak. I\'ve patched it with Gorilla Tape, which seems to be an effective fix, but it is only temporary. I need to replace the bottle. Nowadays, all the rage seems to be for the <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus/handheld-hydration/softbottle/product">new bottles</a> with their <a href="http://www.geartalkwithjasonklass.com/2010/03/designer-backpacking-gear.html">ugly colors</a>. The largest of these is 1 liter, and so not an option for me.\n\nPlatypus also now offers two newer hydration systems. The first is the <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus/hands-free-hydration/hoser/product">Hoser</a>, which is similar to the old bottle, but with a grab loop at one end and an angled port at the other. The manufacturer\'s weight for this system is 3.6oz, which is the same weight that I have measured for my old bottle, hose, and valve. The trouble with the Hoser is that the bottom does away with the traditional expanding bottom of the old bottles in favor of a grab loop. Because of the small opening of the bladders, the best way that I have found to fill it is to scoop up water with something else and pour it into the standing bladder (a method <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSYWoplv_Uo#t=3m31s">made popular by Jason Klass</a>). For one person to achieve this, the bladder has to stand on its own. The Hoser bladder will not, so it isn\'t an option for me.\n\nThe other new offering from Platypus is the <a href="http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platypus/hands-free-hydration/big-zip-sl/product">Big Zip SL</a>. The zipper closer on this addresses the difficulty of filling. The manufacturer\'s listed weight is listed at 5.5oz (though I\'ve heard reports that it is actually heavier): still a good deal lighter than the Camelbak, but significantly heavier than the old bottle system.\n\nI could go back to the old Camelbak, but the weight deters me. It is also difficult to pour precise amounts of water out of the Camelbak bladder for cooking, which is a disadvantage now that I\'m used to the Platypus bottles.\n\nThe other option is a bladder from <a href="http://www.source-military.com/">Source</a>. I first heard of these with <a href="http://militarymorons.com/equipment/outdoor.html#source">MilitaryMoron\'s review</a>. They have many features that are attractive to me, but I haven\'t seen anybody post an accurate weight. Source themselves list their 2L bladder at 0.53lbs (8.48 oz), but they have the same weight listed for the 1.5L and 3L bladders. It seems highly improbable to me that three different sized objects weigh exactly the same. More likely, the manufacturer\'s listed weights are inaccurate. I am assuming that the Source bladders will be heavier than the comparable Platypus Big Zip SL and that they have the potential to be slightly lighter than a Camelbak, but that is only a guess. I would rather not purchase a Source bladder without knowing an accurate weight.\n\nFor now, I think I will buy another 2L Platypus bottle to replace my leaky one. Despite the durability issues, they seem to be the best mix of price, performance, and weight. They must be thought of as disposable, but that is true of all plastic water carriers. I\'m not sure why they have lately become more difficult to acquire from large retailers.\n\nDoes anybody know of any other options that I have overlooked?'

Despite the durability issues, they seem to be the best mix of price, performance, and weight. They must be thought of as disposable, but that is true of all plastic water carriers. I&#8217;m not sure why they have lately become more difficult to acquire from large retailers.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know of any other options that I have overlooked?</p>'
    vellum_post_79.tease = u'<p>In the past, I used Camelbak bladders as my primary water reservoir. I\'ve had three of their military hydration systems and never experienced a leak -- except once when I neglected to fully close the bladder\'s lid. In snowy, alpine conditions I would chuckle at others whose hydration hoses were frozen shut, while I confidently sucked on my insulated Camelbak hose. The Camelbak mouthpiece always insured a high flow-rate, unlike some other brands, and the hose could be shut off at either end, providing further protection against the accidental leaks that have been known to plague other bladders.</p>\n<p>But the Camelbak\'s durability comes at a price.

The road to the trail head is usually closed and impassable in the winter, but this year it was open and free of snow. From the trail head, it\'s only about 3 miles and 2,500 feet to the 5,324 foot summit and the old fire lookout tower. This is the first day hike of the year that I took only a small day pack on, rather than loading up my large rucksack with weights, heavy books, and water. I practically flew up the mountain!\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366221107/" title="Blue Sky by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4366221107_d2e8281b6a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Blue Sky" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIt was a clear day today, without a cloud in the sky. Snow started about a mile up the trail. First, just a little ice and packed slush, but it soon grew to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366224283/in/set-72157623457388158/">about 5 feet deep</a>. Plenty of people had been up the mountain this winter, leaving me <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366226273/in/set-72157623457388158/">a trail of compacted snow</a> to follow and making crampons or snowshoes unnecessary for the way up.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366974136/" title="Snow and Sky by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4366974136_520931a172.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Snow and Sky" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366975118/" title="Snow and Sky by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2782/4366975118_f7d4e35c82.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Snow and Sky" /></a>\n\nFor the most part, it was easy going, until the trail <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366978162/in/set-72157623457388158/">climbed a slope</a> up onto the ridge of the mountain. It was a little steep. I had to climb with both hands, occasionally punching or kicking holds for hands and feet.\n\nFrom then on, the trail followed the ridge, but occasionally meandered slightly down onto the south side of the mountain. The sun had been beating on the snow pretty hard over there, turning what was nice crusty snow on the north side to a wet, slushy mixture. It required careful footing to make my way without sliding down the whole face.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366232879/" title="Pilchuck Lookout by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/4366232879_e7e0f2188e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pilchuck Lookout" /></a>\n\nI summited and arrived at the lookout at about 1:30PM, two hours after leaving the trail head. The sky was still clear, allowing me to see to Mt. Rainier in the south, Mt. Baker in the north, Glacier Peak in the East, the Puget Sound and the Olympics to the West, along with everything in between. I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366986584/in/set-72157623457388158/">opened up a few of the heavy shutters on the tower</a> and spent some time trying to identify <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366988022/in/set-72157623457388158/">various peaks</a> in the visible wilderness areas where I have traveled.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366982622/" title="Pilchuck Lookout and Mt.

I put it off a bit longer by cooking up some ramen and jerk. But, after lunch, I had to turn around and head down.\n\nWhere the trail along the ridge deviated onto the southern face, I had no choice but to squat and slide down on my feet and butt, doing my best to control my decent with a trekking pole. Occasionally this worked. Occasionally I was able to dig my feet in to stop before going off the edge.

Plenty of people had been up the mountain this winter, leaving me <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366226273/in/set-72157623457388158/">a trail of compacted snow</a> to follow and making crampons or snowshoes unnecessary for the way up.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366974136/" title="Snow and Sky by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4366974136_520931a172.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Snow and Sky" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366975118/" title="Snow and Sky by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2782/4366975118_f7d4e35c82.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Snow and Sky" /></a></p>\n<p>For the most part, it was easy going, until the trail <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366978162/in/set-72157623457388158/">climbed a slope</a> up onto the ridge of the mountain. It was a little steep. I had to climb with both hands, occasionally punching or kicking holds for hands and feet.</p>\n<p>From then on, the trail followed the ridge, but occasionally meandered slightly down onto the south side of the mountain. The sun had been beating on the snow pretty hard over there, turning what was nice crusty snow on the north side to a wet, slushy mixture. It required careful footing to make my way without sliding down the whole face.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366232879/" title="Pilchuck Lookout by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/4366232879_e7e0f2188e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pilchuck Lookout" /></a></p>\n<p>I summited and arrived at the lookout at about 1:30PM, two hours after leaving the trail head. The sky was still clear, allowing me to see to Mt. Rainier in the south, Mt. Baker in the north, Glacier Peak in the East, the Puget Sound and the Olympics to the West, along with everything in between. I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366986584/in/set-72157623457388158/">opened up a few of the heavy shutters on the tower</a> and spent some time trying to identify <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366988022/in/set-72157623457388158/">various peaks</a> in the visible wilderness areas where I have traveled.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4366982622/" title="Pilchuck Lookout and Mt.

I put it off a bit longer by cooking up some ramen and jerk. But, after lunch, I had to turn around and head down.</p>\n<p>Where the trail along the ridge deviated onto the southern face, I had no choice but to squat and slide down on my feet and butt, doing my best to control my decent with a trekking pole. Occasionally this worked. Occasionally I was able to dig my feet in to stop before going off the edge.

Last week Rodney sent me one of his new and slightly improved StickPic models.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4253241548/" title="StickPic Comparison by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2690/4253241548_47087539f7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="StickPic Comparison" /></a>\n\nThe first change is in how the markings are applied to the StickPic.

In the old model, pictured on the left, you can see how the thickness of the lettering varies. The new engraving looks more professional, but this is only a cosmetic difference, and not one that I think really matters.\n\nThe next immediately noticeable difference is the nut:\n<blockquote>A new 8 star jam nut is now used which allows the user, while wearing gloves, to easily attach the StickPic to the camera.</blockquote>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4252474091/" title="StickPic Comparison by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4252474091_17af6a09c5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="StickPic Comparison" /></a>\n\nThis is certainly a more significant change than the engraving.

I\'m not sure how much this contributes to security: I installed both StickPics on either one of my poles and shook them around violently. Neither came off. Granted, I didn\'t have the extra weight of a camera attached to either StickPic. But I\'ve also never had my camera fall off the pole during normal use with the old StickPic.\n\nThe weight of the new StickPic has been slightly increased -- probably due to the winged nut. My scale puts the old model at 8 grams and the new one at 10 grams. (Though my scale is only accurate down to 1 gram, so it isn\'t the best for measuring such lightweight items.) Personally, I think the new nut is worth an additional 2 grams!\n\nI think that all three changes to the StickPic are marked improvements, with the new nut being the most significant of the lot. I do not think that any of the changes are enough to warrant purchasing the new model if you are happy with the old one, but they will improve the device for new users.\n\n<h2>Note:</h2>\nIn the above photos, the new StickPic is installed on a trekking pole without a basket. It is not necessary to remove the pole\'s basket to use the StickPic. I simply lost the basket for that pole a while back and never replaced it. Even though it slides much further down the tip of the pole than does the old model, the new StickPic will fit on the other pole without interfering with the basket.'

    vellum_post_91.body = u'The greatest disappointment about any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_knife">Mora knife</a> is the sheath: a flimsy, plastic thing that won\'t easily fit on a decent sized belt and does not even hold the knife very securely. As they come, I consider them unusable. But a few simple modifications and additions make them quite acceptable.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160847927/" title="Mora Sheath Modifications by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/4160847927_743f431323.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mora Sheath Modifications" /></a>\n\nThe Mora knife sheaths are designed to be mounted either on a button on a pair of coveralls or through a belt. Apparently people wear very small, skinny belts in Sweden. Over here in the United States of Gun Belts, that doesn\'t fly. The belt slot on the sheath can be forcefully enlarged by shoving in a piece of wood, such as a ruler, and applying heat to cause the plastic to expand, but I don\'t trust that such an act will not over weaken the plastic. I\'m not a big fan of carrying a Mora directly on my belt, anyway. Usually, I\'ll carry the knife either on a lanyard around my neck or as a dangler off my belt. But both of these setups allow the possibility of the knife and sheath to swing freely, accentuating the problem of an insecure fit.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBoth the problem of how to carry the sheath and the problem of the insecure fit can be addressed with a single piece of paracord.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4161626834/" title="Paracord Loop by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2570/4161626834_6de94cc4de.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Paracord Loop" /></a>\n\nWith the knife in the sheath, I take a piece of paracord and run both ends around the handle and through the slot for the belt. Then, tight against the back of the sheath, I tie an overhand knot in either end of the cord. This creates a loop of paracord on the front of the sheath that can be made smaller, but cannot become any wider than the bottom third of the handle. Because the handles on Mora knifes are somewhat tapered -- fatter in the middle than on either end -- this loop prevents the knife from being removed from the sheath. Even if the knife is only lightly dropped into the sheath rather than securely pressed, it cannot be removed without first sliding off the loop of paracord.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4161614998/" title="Paracord Loop by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2717/4161614998_de7d95d140.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Paracord Loop" /></a>\n\nAfter tying the two knots against the back of the sheath in either end of the paracord, I take both ends and tie them together, forming a loop on the back of the sheath. This provides my carry options.\n\nIf I want to wear the knife around my neck, I take a pre-tied loop of paracord that I carry and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160873405/in/set-72157622943203190/">loop it through itself around the loop on the sheath</a>.\n\nTo carry the knife in a dangler system, I prefer to use a <a href="http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=203&idcategory=0">Maxpedition Keyper</a> rather than a carabiner. The Keyper is mounted on my belt and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4161633582/in/set-72157622943203190/">clipped into the loop of paracord on the sheath</a>. (To reduce movement in this setup, I\'ll stick the knife and sheath in my pocket.)\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160888175/" title="Mora Sheath Modifications by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2686/4160888175_d6023c6cf5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mora Sheath Modifications" /></a>\n\nThe last thing that I do to this part of the sheath is add a small wrap of electrical tape around the very top, covering the upper bit of the belt loop and the button hole. This prevents the paracord from sliding to the top of the sheath and forces the securing loop to be about .75" from the very end of the handle. I\'ve found that if this is not done, the securing loop is like to slip off the handle.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4161623052/" title="Taped Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2520/4161623052_abee8bea47.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Taped Sheath" /></a>\n\nThat\'s all that is needed to make the sheath usable, but a few other additions can be made to increase its utility.\n\nAround the top of the sheath, I wrap tape. In the sheaths pictured here, one has 2" olive drab duct tape, the other has 1" black <a href="http://www.gorillaglue.com/tapes.aspx">Gorilla Tape</a> (which is like duct tape, but thicker and stickier). One can never carry enough tape. I imagine, also, that the tape likely increases the structural integrity of the sheath.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160890293/" title="Repair Needle by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img class="thumb right" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2742/4160890293_7e57e39f67_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Repair Needle" /></a>\n\nOn the back of both sheaths, I have a #17 sailmaking needle, pre-threaded with black kevlar thread, taped down with some electrical tape. As I mentioned in <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/12/01/rat-izula-neck-knife/">my review of the RAT Izula</a>, this is an idea I first picked up from one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=wildernessoutfitters">Dave Canterbury\'s videos</a>. The extra needle and thread adds no noticeable weight and could be a welcome addition to the sheath if you ever find yourself separated from your pack, with the knife and sheath as your only piece of gear.\n\nThe next modification on the body of the sheath was also inspired by Dave Cantebury. In another of his videos, he showed how he had layered different width pieces of inner-tube on a machete sheath to create pockets that could store small items, such as a sharpening stone and magnesium fire starter. With that in mind, I add a wide piece of inner-tube onto the middle of the Mora sheath (which also serves to cover and further secure the taped down needle). Then, on top of that, I put a skinnier piece of inner-tube. Slid between both pieces is a backup ferro rod. Because the rod has rubber below it and rubber atop, there is an incredible amount of friction. The ferro rod becomes difficult to remove. I have carried blank rods in these "pockets" and they have never fallen out. Still, I prefer to carry rods with a lanyard of some sort on them. I loop the rod through its lanyard around the paracord loop on the top of the sheath, guaranteeing that the rod is secured.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4161608200/" title="Mora Sheath Modifications by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2565/4161608200_052433fa15.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mora Sheath Modifications" /></a>\n\nThe sheath for my KJ #1 knife has only a ferro rod. That knife is carbon steel and can generate sparks off the spine. On the sheath for the larger SL-2, however, I have added a small striker slid between the two pieces of inner-tube on the back. The SL-2 is made of laminated steel, <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/29/rubberized-mora-handle/#comment-41473">which is too soft to reliably produce sparks</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160863263/" title="Firesteel and Striker by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2507/4160863263_2855e6afd8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Firesteel and Striker" /></a>\n\nThese modifications made to the Mora sheath help to secure the knife, allow for different carry options, guarantee a source of fire, and provide a needle, thread and tape for repairs. They turn what is otherwise a near useless sheath into a functional item worthy of being matched with the Mora blade.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160881759/" title="Mora Blades by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/4160881759_412ff63f0f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mora Blades" /></a>\n\n(I also own a high-quality leather sheath made by <a href="http://www.jreindustries.com/">JRE Industries</a> for the KJ #1 knife. I tie a loop of paracord through the top loop of leather on the sheath so that the knife may be carried around the neck or on a dangler, similar to the modified plastic sheath. The leather sheath does not require a loop of paracord on the front to secure the handle. Nor does it need pieces of inner-tube to create a pocket for a ferro rod. The only thing that it lacks is a repair needle, but I have found that most tape does not adhere very well to leather, so I cannot stick one on the back.)\n\n<ul class="thumbs">\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160894851/" title="JRE Industries Mora Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2526/4160894851_51f8ec27fe_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="JRE Industries Mora Sheath" /></a></li>\n\t<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4160897049/" title="Neck Lanyard on JRE Industries Mora Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2530/4160897049_89985cc8ee_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Neck Lanyard on JRE Industries Mora Sheath" /></a></li>\n</ul>'

    vellum_post_92.body = u'Yesterday, Avagdu asked me if the <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/store/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=48&amp;products_id=999">Vargo Triad XE</a> stove could be burned inside the cone of my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/01/18/trail-designs-ti-tri-titanium-stove-system/">Trail Designs Ti-Tri Stove System</a>. I\'ve used it in the cone a couple of different times, but never performed any direct comparisons between it and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208387846/">12-10 alcohol stove</a> that comes with the Ti-Tri system. Today, I spent some time with both stoves to do just that. Temperatures were around 42 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nI burned both stoves with the same amount of fuel. One of the downsides of the Triad XE stove is that because the main fuel source is enclosed within the inner container, it cannot be directly lit. Instead, some fuel must be placed within the outer section of the stove. This is then lit to prime the main fuel source. On an alcohol stove where the main fuel is directly accessible, such as the 12-10, the outer priming ring is not always required. It will usually be used when operating in colder temperatures. To be fair for these tests, I primed both stoves with the same amount of alcohol.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe Triad XE stove had to be tested in two different modes: with support legs extended and with support legs collapsed. With the legs collapsed, the stove sits a little lower than the 12-10. With legs extended, it\'s a bit higher. The tests were done on a hard, solid surface so that when the legs were extended they were not pushed into the ground (as they might be when using the stove on dirt). The Triad XE took longer to bring the 2 cups of water to a boil with the legs collapsed, which is to be expected, since the flames are further from the pot.\n\nInterestingly, when the Triad XE\'s legs were extended, it took a significantly shorter period of time than the 12-10 stove to bring the same amount of water to a boil. One would think that the 12-10 stove, being designed by Trail Designs specifically to work within the Ti-Tri cone, would be superior to a general-purpose stove like the Triad XE burning inside the same cone. The Triad XE also had a longer burn time than the 12-10, suggesting that it makes more efficient use of the same amount of fuel (although, in practice, it may require more fuel than the 12-10 since the Triad XE must always be primed and the 12-10 must not).\n\nAll in all, it seems that leaving the 12-10 at home and bringing the Triad XE with the rest of the Ti-Tri system would be a smart move. But then, there are the weights. The Triad XE weighs three times as much as the 12-10 -- certainly a significant amount. Though it must be remembered that the Triad XE is not just an alcohol stove: it is designed to burn solid fuel tabs (Esbit) as well. So, to be fair, if I switched out the 12-10 with the Triad XE, I would also leave Trail Design\'s <a href="http://antigravitygear.com/proddetail.php?prod=TDGRAM">GramCracker burner</a> at home. But the GramCracker tips my scale at 0.1 oz, so it does not really factor in to the decision much. (I also think that the GramCracker most likely burns fuel tabs slightly more efficiently than the Triad XE, but I haven\'t done this comparison yet.)\n\nThe other factor in comparing the two stoves is durability. The Triad XE, being made out of titanium is a tough little guy, not phased by the occasional drop or riding around loose in my pack. In contrast, the 12-10 stove is made out of two thin aluminum cans, making it very delicate.

I&#8217;ve used it in the cone a couple of different times, but never performed any direct comparisons between it and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208387846/">12-10 alcohol stove</a> that comes with the Ti-Tri system. Today, I spent some time with both stoves to do just that. Temperatures were around 42 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>I burned both stoves with the same amount of fuel. One of the downsides of the Triad XE stove is that because the main fuel source is enclosed within the inner container, it cannot be directly lit. Instead, some fuel must be placed within the outer section of the stove. This is then lit to prime the main fuel source. On an alcohol stove where the main fuel is directly accessible, such as the 12-10, the outer priming ring is not always required. It will usually be used when operating in colder temperatures. To be fair for these tests, I primed both stoves with the same amount of alcohol.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The Triad XE stove had to be tested in two different modes: with support legs extended and with support legs collapsed. With the legs collapsed, the stove sits a little lower than the 12-10. With legs extended, it&#8217;s a bit higher. The tests were done on a hard, solid surface so that when the legs were extended they were not pushed into the ground (as they might be when using the stove on dirt). The Triad XE took longer to bring the 2 cups of water to a boil with the legs collapsed, which is to be expected, since the flames are further from the pot.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, when the Triad XE&#8217;s legs were extended, it took a significantly shorter period of time than the 12-10 stove to bring the same amount of water to a boil. One would think that the 12-10 stove, being designed by Trail Designs specifically to work within the Ti-Tri cone, would be superior to a general-purpose stove like the Triad XE burning inside the same cone. The Triad XE also had a longer burn time than the 12-10, suggesting that it makes more efficient use of the same amount of fuel (although, in practice, it may require more fuel than the 12-10 since the Triad XE must always be primed and the 12-10 must not).</p>\n<p>All in all, it seems that leaving the 12-10 at home and bringing the Triad XE with the rest of the Ti-Tri system would be a smart move. But then, there are the weights. The Triad XE weighs three times as much as the 12-10 &#8212; certainly a significant amount. Though it must be remembered that the Triad XE is not just an alcohol stove: it is designed to burn solid fuel tabs (Esbit) as well. So, to be fair, if I switched out the 12-10 with the Triad XE, I would also leave Trail Design&#8217;s <a href="http://antigravitygear.com/proddetail.php?prod=TDGRAM">GramCracker burner</a> at home. But the GramCracker tips my scale at 0.1 oz, so it does not really factor in to the decision much. (I also think that the GramCracker most likely burns fuel tabs slightly more efficiently than the Triad XE, but I haven&#8217;t done this comparison yet.)</p>\n<p>The other factor in comparing the two stoves is durability. The Triad XE, being made out of titanium is a tough little guy, not phased by the occasional drop or riding around loose in my pack. In contrast, the 12-10 stove is made out of two thin aluminum cans, making it very delicate. Even though it lives within the protective <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207526647/in/set-72157612681073007/">plastic caddy</a> of the Ti-Tri, it has numerous scratches and dents to show for its year in use.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what conclusion to draw.

    vellum_post_93.body = u'The <a href="http://www.kmmatchcase.com">K &amp; M Industries Match Case</a> has long been considered one of the top waterproof match cases available. Each case is hand made in the Elk River, Idaho garage of Keith and Marge Lunders.\n\nThe match cases are available in either brass or aluminum and come in two different sizes. The standard length cases are 3 7/8", designed to fit 2 3/8" strike-anywhere matches. The long length cases, measuring in at 4 1/4", are designed for <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/617046">REI Storm Proof Matches</a>. Aluminum cases are available in black, silver, green, or red.\n\nLast winter, I bought a standard length, black aluminum case. It has been part of my wilderness EDC for close to a year.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153919136/" title="K &amp; M Match Case by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2766/4153919136_85f86fe8e7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThough I don\'t always use them, I always carry matches into the wilderness, in addition to at least one BIC lighter and a multitude of ferro rods. Ferro rods are my primary means of starting fire -- usually with some synthetic tinder, such as Vaseline soaked cotton balls. It\'s also my primary way of starting my alcohol stoves. If I\'m not having luck with the rod, or all my tinder is wet, I can move to a lighter or a match to get the fire going. I\'ve also found that when it gets to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit or below, denatured alcohol does not like to take a spark -- instead requiring a match or lighter to start my stove.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153936522/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Contents by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2587/4153936522_d0fba2b150.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Contents" /></a>\n\nA lighter is of course the easiest way of starting a fire, but because I carry a BIC lighter, it is not always dependable. If it was submerged, it will need some time to dry out before working. If there are high winds, the flame will no doubt get blown out. I have previously carried waterproof, windproof butane lighters, but those seem to eat through the fuel way too fast to be practical wilderness devices. It is difficult to justify the huge price increase in one compared to a BIC lighter. The other problem with BIC lighters is that it can be hard to determine how much fuel you have left. You can judge the weight, shake it around next to your ear and listen, but it\'s a rough estimate at best. That\'s what I like about matches: you can count how many you have. For this simple reason, I am sometimes likely to go to my matches rather than my lighter when I need ready-made flame.\n\nCarrying the aforementioned REI Storm Proof Matches also addresses some of the other concerns of the BIC lighter: they will light when wet (if lit and then submerged, they will quickly relight themselves after you remove them from the water) and are nigh impossible to blow out. This makes them a great emergency fire source, but, like the fancy butane lighters, are relatively expensive compared to standard strike-anywhere matches. Because of this, I carry both: normal strike-anywhere matches for general use and REI Storm Proof Matches for when the elements are against me. The REI Storm Proof Matches, being pretty darn waterproof, aren\'t in much need of a waterproof case (I imagine that they will get soggy and useless if they\'re kept underwater for a long period of time, but if you accidentally take a bath during a river crossing and crawl out within a couple minutes, the matches should be fine). Strike-anywhere matches, on the other hand, do need extra protection. Hence why I decided to start with the standard size K &amp; M case.\n\nAll K &amp; M match cases feature a unique closure system. The lid itself has two o-rings on it to prevent any water leakage (guaranteed to 2000 psi of water pressure). It\'s not a screw on lid, but simply pressed onto the case. After the lid is on, you then twist the cap, which in turn twists and tightens the thin nylon lanyard around the body of the case, ensuring that the fit remains tight. Ingenious, simple, and effective.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153926244/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Lid by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2548/4153926244_3bd2976d54.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Lid" /></a>\n\nThe body of the case itself is about 3" (not including the cap). The bottom half is smooth, while the top bit is etched with a pattern that ensures a good grip can be had on the case, even when you and it are soaked.\n\nThe top of the lid sports a small Suunto compass for general direction finding, greatly increasing the utility of the item. This isn\'t some cheap, $1 knock-off button compass, either. Suunto compasses can be depended upon.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153162747/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Compass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2802/4153162747_f4b2d1b458.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Compass" /></a>\n\nThe outer rim of the lid has been etched in the same manner as the top half of the body for grip, but the case also comes with a small protective piece of plastic that slides snugly over the lid, protecting the face of the compass. With this installed, you loose the extra grip on the lid. This may be a problem in some conditions.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153161447/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Top by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2760/4153161447_1c907738d4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Top" /></a>\n\nThe lanyard, after it does its thing tightening the lid, extends down past the body of the case for about 12", terminating in a loop, which allows the case to be securely fastened to your person.\n\nThe inside of the lid is roughened, which is supposed to provide a surface for striking the matches. Perhaps I don\'t know how to strike a match, but it\'s never worked for me. In fact, as a general rule, I find strike-anywhere matches to actually be strike-anywhere-there-is-a-commercial-match-striking-surface matches. I never have luck attempting to strike matches on any old rough surface. But that\'s not a problem: all REI Storm Proof Matches come with extra striking surfaces inside the box. They\'re pretty heavy duty, work with all types of matches, and come sealed in plastic. I tend to collect them and stash them everywhere. For the K &amp; M match case, I cut off a small piece that would fit on the bottom of the lid and super-glued it on. This guarantees me a working surface to strike my matches.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153927848/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Lid with Striker by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4153927848_225944181b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Lid with Striker" /></a>\n\nThe rest of the striker I put back in it\'s plastic cover and store in the body of the case, for use as a backup. The plastic prevents it from striking and lighting any of the matches.\n\nBecause of the striking surface on the lid, I store all the matches tip down, so that they won\'t accidentally light and turn the case into a bomb. With the the extra striker stored, I can jam in about 25 matches, give or take a few. You could fit in more if you removed the striker. The match case is also a nice place to carry a pre-threaded needle or two for emergency repairs.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153938302/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Contents by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2718/4153938302_0fa8b96cfc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Contents" /></a>\n\nAround the outside of the case, I keep a length of that same 700x35 bicycle inner-tube that I have around my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/28/rubberized-bic-lighter/">BIC</a> and a couple of my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/29/rubberized-mora-handle/">Moras</a>. The inner-tube, along with matches that are guaranteed to be dry, gives me a sure-fire method of fire starting.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153185537/" title="Rubberized K &amp; M Match Case by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2570/4153185537_0ff845c7f9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Rubberized K &amp; M Match Case" /></a>\n\nBoth the brass and aluminum cases sell for $19 each. That may seem like a lot of money for a simple match case, particularly when you can pick up a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/678278">cheap-o plastic one for $1.75</a>, but I think it is well worth the money. The brass case looks a lot nicer and is more durable, but is a good deal heavier than the aluminum.\n\nSome day I would like to acquire one of the long aluminum cases for my REI Storm Proof Matches, even though it is not strictly necessary.\n\nI also own a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1935948125/">TAD Gear Life Capsule O.K.</a>, which makes a good match case. The TAD Capsule is equally waterproof and also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1935948151/">includes a compass in one end</a> (albeit a cheaper one), but because of the significantly increased weight of the TAD capsule over the K &amp; M case, I think the K &amp; M is a superior product.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153944206/" title="TAD Gear Life Capsule O.K.

Compass" /></a>\n\nAnother review of the case, along with some discussion of matches, can be found at <a href="http://www.britishblades.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10196">British Blades</a>. I thought I remembered Schwert doing a review of the case on the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/11/14/outdoors-magazine-mirror/">now defunct Outdoors Magazine</a>, but I cannot find it in the archives.'

For the K &amp; M match case, I cut off a small piece that would fit on the bottom of the lid and super-glued it on. This guarantees me a working surface to strike my matches.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153927848/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Lid with Striker by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4153927848_225944181b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Lid with Striker" /></a></p>\n<p>The rest of the striker I put back in it&#8217;s plastic cover and store in the body of the case, for use as a backup. The plastic prevents it from striking and lighting any of the matches.</p>\n<p>Because of the striking surface on the lid, I store all the matches tip down, so that they won&#8217;t accidentally light and turn the case into a bomb. With the the extra striker stored, I can jam in about 25 matches, give or take a few. You could fit in more if you removed the striker. The match case is also a nice place to carry a pre-threaded needle or two for emergency repairs.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153938302/" title="K &amp; M Match Case: Contents by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2718/4153938302_0fa8b96cfc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="K &amp; M Match Case: Contents" /></a></p>\n<p>Around the outside of the case, I keep a length of that same 700x35 bicycle inner-tube that I have around my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/28/rubberized-bic-lighter/">BIC</a> and a couple of my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/11/29/rubberized-mora-handle/">Moras</a>.

The TAD Capsule is equally waterproof and also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1935948151/">includes a compass in one end</a> (albeit a cheaper one), but because of the significantly increased weight of the TAD capsule over the K &amp; M case, I think the K &amp; M is a superior product.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4153944206/" title="TAD Gear Life Capsule O.K.

    vellum_post_94.body = u'My primary <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/edc/">EDC</a> knife for the past few years has been a plain-edge <a href="http://www.emersonknives.com/ekMini_Commander_BTS.php">Emerson Mini-Commander</a>. It\'s a great little knife: an ideal size for EDC and extraordinarily tough for a folder. I\'ve used it as a pry-bar a few different times on objects that I would be afraid to pry with some fixed-blade knives. The Mini-Commander is no worse for the wear.\n\nStill, I\'ve often thought that I would like to EDC a fixed blade. After all, despite it\'s toughness, the Mini-Commander is a folder and that gives it some limitations. I\'ve also found that the grind and shape of the blade is not ideal for some wood-working and wilderness survival tasks. Making feather sticks with it isn\'t easy.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI have carried a small <a href="http://www.nemesis-knives.com/fixed.htm">Nemesis Hellion</a> around my neck most every day for the past couple years. It\'s a fixed blade, but quite small. As I\'ve stated elsewhere, I think of the Hellion as a novelty item and a fun toy more than a tool. It\'s extremely concealable due to its size, but could by no means replace the Mini-Commander.\n\nFolding knives are fairly common and tend not to frighten many people. Fixed blades, on the other hand, are not so common out of the wilderness and rural areas. Now, I\'ll admit that I have no idea concerning the legality of carrying a fixed blade in urban environments. I tried reading up on knife laws a number of years ago and quickly gave up -- they are so convoluted and contradictory as to be meaningless. And so, for me, they are. I ignore them. So far that seems to work out pretty well. I don\'t seem to recall granting any government the right to regulate a tool such as a knife, anyways. Still, I do concern myself with other people\'s feelings and, as odd as it is, some people feel nervous around folks with fixed blade knives strapped to their hips. Even something like a nice 4-5" bushcraft blade on the belt doesn\'t seem to fly in a city. I needed something more concealable, but still of a size large enough to be of some use.\n\nTwo products immediately jump out as a perfect solution (well, three, but I can\'t afford another <a href="http://www.chrisreeve.com/professionalsoldier.htm">Chris Reeve knife</a>): the <a href="http://www.eseeknives.com/neck_knife.htm">RAT Izula</a> and the <a href="https://www.kabar.com/product/productDetail.do?productNumber=BK11&mode=category&categoryId=1,2,3,7,8,9&categoryName=Military/Tactical">Becker Necker</a>. Both knives are small and flat, which lends them to a number of different carry options, but large enough to function as utilitarian tools. The Izula is 6.25" over all, with a 2.88" blade and 3.37" handle. The Becker Necker comes in with a larger 3.25" blade and 3.5" handle for an overall length of 6.75". For the slight difference in overall length, one would think that jumping on the Becker Necker for the larger blade would be the way to go. After all, that extra .37" of blade could equate to more utility. But in searching around the internet and reading a number of comparisons, it became evident that the RAT Izula was the favored knife. It seems to be the consensus that, comparatively, the Becker Necker has too little handle for its length of blade. I don\'t consider my hands to be large, but they certainly aren\'t small, and I know that having too small a handle could completely ruin a knife for me, regardless of the quality of the blade. So, I chose the Izula.\n\n<h2>Izula Options</h2>\n\nThe Izula can be purchased in two different packages: either the standard knife and sheath, which RAT asks around $80 for (way overpriced) but can easily be got for closer to $50 (a reasonable price) or as part of a "survival kit". The "survival kit" starts with the same knife and sheath, but also includes a MOLLE lock, paracord, cord lock, snap, split ring, ferro rod, and whistle. RAT asks $100 for this complete kit (crazy) though $60-$70 seems the going rate for most merchants. The "survival kit" did not appeal to me. I already have paracord, ferro rods, cord locks, and split rings. The only useful item in the kit seemed to be the MOLLE lock. I decided to save the money and get only the basic knife and sheath.\n\nThe Izula also comes in four different colors, which is a bit fun: black, desert tan, olive drab, and, best of all, pink. I was quite tempted to get the pink, especially given my concern over other people\'s feelings of fixed blades. Who could be afraid of a man with a pink knife? But it turns out that I was able to find the desert tan knife for less money on eBay than I could get the pink knife for, so I went with tan.\n\n<h2>Edge</h2>\n\nThe flat ground 1095 steel takes an edge very easily on my Japanese water stones. With the stones and a leather strop, I can get Izula as sharp as my high-carbon, scandi-grind, bushcraft blades. Scary sharp. In fact, the knife is very, very impressive in what it can do. Its only limitation is its short blade and, for longer sessions of use, the bare, skeletonized handle.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151155806/" title="RAT Izula Blade by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2768/4151155806_47fd6f3dbf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Blade" /></a>\n\n<h2>Handle</h2>\n\nWhen I first got the knife, I took some olive drab paracord and wrapped it in the way instructed on the <a href="http://www.eseeknives.com/esee-izula-sheet-back.pdf">back of the Izula instruction sheet</a>. The current paracord wrap that I have on the handle is a <a href ="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3472rPavR50">180 degree katana wrap</a>. I first did this with normal paracord, but found that it made the handle a little too thick, so I went back and did it again with gutted paracord. That worked out better, but, being gutted, the paracord does not add a whole lot of extra padding. At the end of the day, the katana wrap is more for looks. The wrap that RAT recommends is a more practical way to pad the handle and carry spare paracord, but it doesn\'t look anywhere near as cool!\n\nAt the end of the handle, I finished the wrap with a simple overhand knot. I had a unused skull bead laying around, so I decided to leave the two tail ends of paracord a bit long and thread the skull bead through them. By sliding the skull bead to the end, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151166098/in/set-72157622790436729/">I create a loop for my wrist</a>. Rather than tying the ends of the cord together, I tied an overhand knot in each one separately, which prevents me from accidentally pulling the bead off, but also means that I can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150404441/in/set-72157622790436729/">slide the bead to the top and just have two loose ends of cord</a>, rather than a loop that will no doubt get caught on things. Honestly, I\'m not a big fan of wrist lanyards on knives. I rarely ever use them. But I am a fan of skull beads. Like the rest of the wrap, this lanyard bit is on there just because it looks cool.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151159578/" title="RAT Izula Handle Paracord Wrap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2592/4151159578_5f4f4f2729.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Handle Paracord Wrap" /></a>\n\n<h2>Sheath</h2>\n\nThe sheath itself was the surprise in this whole package. It is some sort of "injection molded thermoplastic" that is supposed to be more cold tolerant than Kydex. I\'ve never had a problem with Kydex in the winter, but apparently extreme cold makes the Kydex brittle and prone to crack. The fit of the sheath was what most impressed me. It is, without doubt, the best fitting sheath I have ever had for a knife. The knife pops right in there and is completely locked -- no wiggling or movement what-so-ever.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150422203/" title="RAT Izula Neck Knife by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2519/4150422203_80818c0192.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Neck Knife" /></a>\n\n<h3>Mods</h3>\n\nI\'ve taken a size 14 sail-making needle pre-threaded with a length of black Kevlar thread and taped this to the back of the sheath with a piece of electrical tape. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=wildernessoutfitters">Dave Cantebury</a> did this in a video on a Mora knife sheath a few months back. I thought it was a great idea.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151175680/" title="RAT Izula Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2705/4151175680_22510cd5dc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Sheath" /></a>\n\nIt doesn\'t add any noticeable weight. Even though I carry a sewing kit in my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/06/07/possibles-pouch/">possibles pouch</a>, I\'ve since taped a prethreaded needle to the back of all my plastic knife sheaths. (Tape doesn\'t stick too well to leather, so I haven\'t figured out how to carry a needle on my leather sheaths). Around the bottom of the sheath, I wrapped a bit more electrical tape (I was out of 1" duct tape at the time). There probably isn\'t more than 2 or 3 feet. It never hurts to carry extra tape!\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151173378/" title="RAT Izula Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2545/4151173378_06a7e5ed5f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Sheath" /></a>\n\n<h3>Carry Options</h3>\n\nSome people have complained about the sheath because it doesn\'t come with a belt clip of any sort. This worried me as well. I wasn\'t sure that I would want to carry it around the neck all the time and, since I didn\'t go for the expensive kit that included the MOLLE clip, I did not know what other mounting options I would be able to come up with. It turns out that with only a cord lock (self supplied out of my repair box, since I didn\'t get the "survival kit") and a little over two feet of paracord, the sheath becomes remarkably configurable.\n\n<h4>Neck Carry</h4>\n\nTo carry it around the neck, I simply slide the cord lock over both ends of the paracord, put the cord through the top hole in the sheath, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151170378/in/set-72157622790436729/">loop it through itself</a>. The cord lock allows me to adjust how high or low it sits on my chest. As with the wrist lanyard, I put <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151186016/in/set-72157622790436729/">an overhand knot in each end of the paracord</a> to prevent me from accidentally pulling the cord lock off, but refrain from tying the two ends of cord together. I don\'t want to create a secondary, smaller loop on the back of my neck for things to get caught on when I adjust the cord lock up.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150420251/" title="RAT Izula Neck Knife by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4150420251_dd6d1baa28.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Neck Knife" /></a>\n\nAs I mentioned above, I initially thought that I might not want to carry the Izula around my neck. It\'s a good deal bigger, heavier, and bulkier than the Nemesis Hellion neck knife that I\'m used to. But I was pleasantly surprised. The profile of the knife is slim enough so that it can almost completely disappear under only a t-shirt. Unlike the Hellion, you are probably not going to forget that it\'s there because of the weight, but it is by no means uncomfortable.\n\nA lot of folks who carry a neck knife go on about the danger of using knotted paracord as a lanyard. Paracord is very strong. Someone sneaking up from behind could grab the cord and strangle the wearer rather easily. If this concerns you, you could use some weaker cord (or chain), tie a slip knot, or invest in some sort of break away device. Personally, I\'m more concerned with the security of the knife around my neck (which sort of rules out slip knots) and I like the simplicity of this system. In the years that I have been carrying the Nemesis Hellion around my neck on gutted paracord, I have yet to be strangled. But it is something to be aware of -- especially if you find yourself getting in a tussle fairly frequently. Do remember, though, that the paracord around you neck is attached to a knife, and knives <em>cut things</em>.\n\n<h4>Front Pocket (TAD style)</h4>\n\nMy favorite way to carry the Izula is in one of the two front pockets that <a href="http://www.tadgear.com">Triple Aught Design</a> places on their pants. In my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2007/10/22/tad-gear-force-10-legionnaire-classic-cargo-pants/">Legionnaires</a>, I carry the knife in the left front pocket. It sits in the pocket rather securely, with only the top half of the handle exposed, leaning to the right. This allows for a very fast, right-handed cross draw. I have the paracord and cord lock setup and attached to the sheath the same as in the above neck carry option, but in this setup I\'ll put the cord through the plastic D-ring above the front pocket and loop it through itself so that the sheath and knife are securely attached me. Normally, when I draw from this setup, I\'ll <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151190600/in/set-72157622790436729/">grab the handle and push against the sheath with my thumb</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150433721/in/set-72157622790436729/">popping the knife free</a>. But because the cord is attached to the D-ring, I can also just grab the handle and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151197346/in/set-72157622790436729/">yank it to my right</a>, extending the cord till it reaches its full length and pops the knife free. Personally, I feel that this is too obtuse a movement, so I prefer popping the knife free of the sheath with my thumb. If you prefer the latter option of yanking the knife, you could move the cord lock a few inches up the cord, thus shortening the distance you have to pull before fully extending the cord and popping the knife free. I will usually leave the cord lock all the way against the knots at the end of the cord and stuff the excess amount of cordage in the bottom of the same front pocket.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150429799/" title="RAT Izula Front Pocket Carry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/4150429799_7637c92206.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Front Pocket Carry" /></a>\n\n<h4>Side Pocket</h4>\n\nAs much as I prefer the above option, not all of us wear TAD pants every single day. When wearing another pair of pants, I will carry the Izula in the right side pocket, tip down. I found that most pockets are sized so that the tip of the sheath reaches the bottom of the pocket with only about the top 1/4" of the handle sticking out. Again, I keep the paracord and cord lock attached as before, with the cord lock slid all the way against the knots at the end, creating a big loop. This loop I run through my belt, guaranteeing the the sheath and knife are securely attached to me. To draw, I reach my hand in the pocket, grab the handle, and push against the sheath with my thumb, popping free the knife. I\'m required to get my whole hand into the pocket to grasp the handle, which makes the knife slightly slower to draw than a folding pocket knife clipped into the same pocket (especially compared to an Emerson with the <a href="http://www.emersonknives.com/UsingWaveFeature.html">wave feature</a>, such as the Mini-Commander).\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151199562/" title="RAT Izula Side Pocket Carry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4151199562_1ef1e3fef7.jpg" width="500" height="485" alt="RAT Izula Side Pocket Carry" /></a>\n\nBecause the cord is attached to my belt I could just grab the handle and pull out or up, extending the cord till the knife pops free, but this is even more obtuse a movement than when drawing in the same manner from a front pocket. I\'m not a fan.\n\n<h4>Belt</h4>\n\nThe paracord and cord lock really become useful when you decide you want to carry the Izula on your belt. The first step is to unloop the cord from the sheath. Then remove the knot in either end of the cord so that the cord lock can be removed. Next, thread either end of the cord through the two holes in the side of the sheath and the reinstall the cord lock, retying the same knot in either end of the cord to prevent the cord lock from being removed.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150444613/" title="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2684/4150444613_eac52ac3da.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard" /></a>\n\nMove the cord lock about halfway up the cord, grab a bit of the cord and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150447703/in/set-72157622790436729/">pull it through the large slit</a> opposite the two holes on the sheath. What you now have on the front of the sheath is a line of paracord crossing the top horizontally and, on the bottom, the cord coming together horizontally to the cord lock. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150449563/in/set-72157622790436729/">On the back of the sheath</a> you have two vertical loops that you can thread your belt through.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150451651/" title="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2517/4150451651_e4552a79c8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard" /></a>\n\nWith the sheath attached to your belt, you can then move the cord lock tight against the sheath, pulling as much paracord through the lock as you can. The Izula will then be mounted on your belt.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150453455/" title="RAT Izula Belt Carry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2784/4150453455_138175072d.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="RAT Izula Belt Carry" /></a>\n\nWhen I first saw this carry option pictured in the manual that RAT provides with the Izula, I was skeptical of using the paracord this way. I didn\'t think that you could could get the paracord tight enough to eliminate any wiggling or movement. I\'ve now carried the knife a good deal like this and I am perfectly happy with it. The sheath is just as secure as a sheath with a belt clip or malice clip (albeit easier to cut off). If you keep it attached to your belt consistently for a few days, the cord lock will eventually slide down a bit, loosening up the cord and causing the sheath to move a little when the knife is drawn. This can be addressed by checking the tightness of the lock once a day every time you put on your pants, which I don\'t think is too much to ask.\n\nThe downside to this method is that, because we\'re using the same piece of paracord as we use when wearing the knife around our neck, the paracord is necessarily long. You will have 6" or so or cord dangling below the lowest point of the sheath. This would be a problem if the two ends of the cord had been tied together, forming a loop, but because they have not been tied thusly, the two ends are loose and will not get caught on anything. They don\'t bother me.\n\n<h2>Spine</h2>\n\nThe spine itself is .156" thick, with about 1/2" of a grooved thumb ramp at the start of the blade. I\'ve never found these thumb ramps to be necessary on any knife, but they don\'t get in the way, either.\n\nInitially, I found that I could not generate any sparks by sparking the spine of the Izula against a ferro rod. I know 1095 is high-carbon, so I figured it must either be the tan-colored paint that was preventing me from getting any sparks, or the corner of the spine was slightly rounded. To address both potential problems I set the spine flat on top of a coarse silicon-carbide stone and slowly ground down the first 2" from the tip. This removes the paint and squares off the edge, giving a 90 degree angle that should be ideal for striking sparks. With that change made, the Izula will throw a decent shower of sparks.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150399103/" title="RAT Izula Spine by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/4150399103_27f730a8c3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Spine" /></a>\n\n<h2>Overall</h2>\n\nI\'ve been EDCing the RAT Izula for just over two months now. So far, I have been extremely impressed with the knife. Unless I am for some reason forced to carry a folder instead of a fixed blade, I doubt that I will go back to carrying the Emerson Mini-Commander. Direct comparison between a fixed blade and a folder is not exactly fair since they have both been designed with different intentions and are markedly different tools, but I find the Izula to be a superior knife. If I woke up in the zombie apocalypse, I\'d much rather find the Izula in my pocket than the Mini-Commander.\n\nIf you think you can get away with EDCing a fixed blade, I\'d strongly urge you to consider the Izula. As I mentioned in the beginning, the $80 that RAT asks for the knife is overpriced, but it\'s not hard to pick up an Izula for closer to $50, which I think is a very good value. (It\'s certainly cheaper than a quality folder like an Emerson!)\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151150936/" title="RAT Izula Neck Knife by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/4151150936_2b679b015e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Neck Knife" /></a>'
    vellum_post_94.body_rendered = u'<p>My primary <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/tag/edc/">EDC</a> knife for the past few years has been a plain-edge <a href="http://www.emersonknives.com/ekMini_Commander_BTS.php">Emerson Mini-Commander</a>. It&#8217;s a great little knife: an ideal size for EDC and extraordinarily tough for a folder. I&#8217;ve used it as a pry-bar a few different times on objects that I would be afraid to pry with some fixed-blade knives. The Mini-Commander is no worse for the wear.</p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;ve often thought that I would like to EDC a fixed blade. After all, despite it&#8217;s toughness, the Mini-Commander is a folder and that gives it some limitations. I&#8217;ve also found that the grind and shape of the blade is not ideal for some wood-working and wilderness survival tasks. Making feather sticks with it isn&#8217;t easy.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I have carried a small <a href="http://www.nemesis-knives.com/fixed.htm">Nemesis Hellion</a> around my neck most every day for the past couple years. It&#8217;s a fixed blade, but quite small. As I&#8217;ve stated elsewhere, I think of the Hellion as a novelty item and a fun toy more than a tool. It&#8217;s extremely concealable due to its size, but could by no means replace the Mini-Commander.</p>\n<p>Folding knives are fairly common and tend not to frighten many people. Fixed blades, on the other hand, are not so common out of the wilderness and rural areas. Now, I&#8217;ll admit that I have no idea concerning the legality of carrying a fixed blade in urban environments. I tried reading up on knife laws a number of years ago and quickly gave up &#8212; they are so convoluted and contradictory as to be meaningless. And so, for me, they are. I ignore them. So far that seems to work out pretty well. I don&#8217;t seem to recall granting any government the right to regulate a tool such as a knife, anyways. Still, I do concern myself with other people&#8217;s feelings and, as odd as it is, some people feel nervous around folks with fixed blade knives strapped to their hips. Even something like a nice 4-5&#8221; bushcraft blade on the belt doesn&#8217;t seem to fly in a city. I needed something more concealable, but still of a size large enough to be of some use.</p>\n<p>Two products immediately jump out as a perfect solution (well, three, but I can&#8217;t afford another <a href="http://www.chrisreeve.com/professionalsoldier.htm">Chris Reeve knife</a>): the <a href="http://www.eseeknives.com/neck_knife.htm">RAT Izula</a> and the <a href="https://www.kabar.com/product/productDetail.do?productNumber=BK11&amp;mode=category&amp;categoryId=1,2,3,7,8,9&amp;categoryName=Military/Tactical">Becker Necker</a>. Both knives are small and flat, which lends them to a number of different carry options, but large enough to function as utilitarian tools. The Izula is 6.25&#8221; over all, with a 2.88&#8221; blade and 3.37&#8221; handle. The Becker Necker comes in with a larger 3.25&#8221; blade and 3.5&#8221; handle for an overall length of 6.75&#8221;. For the slight difference in overall length, one would think that jumping on the Becker Necker for the larger blade would be the way to go. After all, that extra .37&#8221; of blade could equate to more utility. But in searching around the internet and reading a number of comparisons, it became evident that the RAT Izula was the favored knife. It seems to be the consensus that, comparatively, the Becker Necker has too little handle for its length of blade. I don&#8217;t consider my hands to be large, but they certainly aren&#8217;t small, and I know that having too small a handle could completely ruin a knife for me, regardless of the quality of the blade. So, I chose the Izula.</p>\n<h2>Izula Options</h2>\n\n<p>The Izula can be purchased in two different packages: either the standard knife and sheath, which RAT asks around $80 for (way overpriced) but can easily be got for closer to $50 (a reasonable price) or as part of a &#8220;survival kit&#8221;. The &#8220;survival kit&#8221; starts with the same knife and sheath, but also includes a MOLLE lock, paracord, cord lock, snap, split ring, ferro rod, and whistle. RAT asks $100 for this complete kit (crazy) though $60-$70 seems the going rate for most merchants. The &#8220;survival kit&#8221; did not appeal to me. I already have paracord, ferro rods, cord locks, and split rings. The only useful item in the kit seemed to be the MOLLE lock. I decided to save the money and get only the basic knife and sheath.</p>\n<p>The Izula also comes in four different colors, which is a bit fun: black, desert tan, olive drab, and, best of all, pink. I was quite tempted to get the pink, especially given my concern over other people&#8217;s feelings of fixed blades. Who could be afraid of a man with a pink knife? But it turns out that I was able to find the desert tan knife for less money on eBay than I could get the pink knife for, so I went with tan.</p>\n<h2>Edge</h2>\n\n<p>The flat ground 1095 steel takes an edge very easily on my Japanese water stones. With the stones and a leather strop, I can get Izula as sharp as my high-carbon, scandi-grind, bushcraft blades. Scary sharp. In fact, the knife is very, very impressive in what it can do. Its only limitation is its short blade and, for longer sessions of use, the bare, skeletonized handle.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151155806/" title="RAT Izula Blade by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2768/4151155806_47fd6f3dbf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Blade" /></a>\n<h2>Handle</h2></p>\n<p>When I first got the knife, I took some olive drab paracord and wrapped it in the way instructed on the <a href="http://www.eseeknives.com/esee-izula-sheet-back.pdf">back of the Izula instruction sheet</a>. The current paracord wrap that I have on the handle is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3472rPavR50">180 degree katana wrap</a>. I first did this with normal paracord, but found that it made the handle a little too thick, so I went back and did it again with gutted paracord. That worked out better, but, being gutted, the paracord does not add a whole lot of extra padding. At the end of the day, the katana wrap is more for looks. The wrap that RAT recommends is a more practical way to pad the handle and carry spare paracord, but it doesn&#8217;t look anywhere near as cool!</p>\n<p>At the end of the handle, I finished the wrap with a simple overhand knot. I had a unused skull bead laying around, so I decided to leave the two tail ends of paracord a bit long and thread the skull bead through them. By sliding the skull bead to the end, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151166098/in/set-72157622790436729/">I create a loop for my wrist</a>. Rather than tying the ends of the cord together, I tied an overhand knot in each one separately, which prevents me from accidentally pulling the bead off, but also means that I can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150404441/in/set-72157622790436729/">slide the bead to the top and just have two loose ends of cord</a>, rather than a loop that will no doubt get caught on things. Honestly, I&#8217;m not a big fan of wrist lanyards on knives. I rarely ever use them. But I am a fan of skull beads. Like the rest of the wrap, this lanyard bit is on there just because it looks cool.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151159578/" title="RAT Izula Handle Paracord Wrap by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2592/4151159578_5f4f4f2729.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Handle Paracord Wrap" /></a>\n<h2>Sheath</h2></p>\n<p>The sheath itself was the surprise in this whole package. It is some sort of &#8220;injection molded thermoplastic&#8221; that is supposed to be more cold tolerant than Kydex. I&#8217;ve never had a problem with Kydex in the winter, but apparently extreme cold makes the Kydex brittle and prone to crack. The fit of the sheath was what most impressed me. It is, without doubt, the best fitting sheath I have ever had for a knife. The knife pops right in there and is completely locked &#8212; no wiggling or movement what-so-ever.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150422203/" title="RAT Izula Neck Knife by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2519/4150422203_80818c0192.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Neck Knife" /></a>\n<h3>Mods</h3></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve taken a size 14 sail-making needle pre-threaded with a length of black Kevlar thread and taped this to the back of the sheath with a piece of electrical tape. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=wildernessoutfitters">Dave Cantebury</a> did this in a video on a Mora knife sheath a few months back. I thought it was a great idea.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151175680/" title="RAT Izula Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2705/4151175680_22510cd5dc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Sheath" /></a></p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t add any noticeable weight. Even though I carry a sewing kit in my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/06/07/possibles-pouch/">possibles pouch</a>, I&#8217;ve since taped a prethreaded needle to the back of all my plastic knife sheaths. (Tape doesn&#8217;t stick too well to leather, so I haven&#8217;t figured out how to carry a needle on my leather sheaths). Around the bottom of the sheath, I wrapped a bit more electrical tape (I was out of 1&#8221; duct tape at the time). There probably isn&#8217;t more than 2 or 3 feet. It never hurts to carry extra tape!</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151173378/" title="RAT Izula Sheath by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2545/4151173378_06a7e5ed5f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Sheath" /></a>\n<h3>Carry Options</h3></p>\n<p>Some people have complained about the sheath because it doesn&#8217;t come with a belt clip of any sort. This worried me as well. I wasn&#8217;t sure that I would want to carry it around the neck all the time and, since I didn&#8217;t go for the expensive kit that included the MOLLE clip, I did not know what other mounting options I would be able to come up with. It turns out that with only a cord lock (self supplied out of my repair box, since I didn&#8217;t get the &#8220;survival kit&#8221;) and a little over two feet of paracord, the sheath becomes remarkably configurable.</p>\n<h4>Neck Carry</h4>\n\n<p>To carry it around the neck, I simply slide the cord lock over both ends of the paracord, put the cord through the top hole in the sheath, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151170378/in/set-72157622790436729/">loop it through itself</a>. The cord lock allows me to adjust how high or low it sits on my chest. As with the wrist lanyard, I put <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151186016/in/set-72157622790436729/">an overhand knot in each end of the paracord</a> to prevent me from accidentally pulling the cord lock off, but refrain from tying the two ends of cord together. I don&#8217;t want to create a secondary, smaller loop on the back of my neck for things to get caught on when I adjust the cord lock up.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150420251/" title="RAT Izula Neck Knife by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4150420251_dd6d1baa28.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Neck Knife" /></a></p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I initially thought that I might not want to carry the Izula around my neck. It&#8217;s a good deal bigger, heavier, and bulkier than the Nemesis Hellion neck knife that I&#8217;m used to. But I was pleasantly surprised. The profile of the knife is slim enough so that it can almost completely disappear under only a t-shirt. Unlike the Hellion, you are probably not going to forget that it&#8217;s there because of the weight, but it is by no means uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>A lot of folks who carry a neck knife go on about the danger of using knotted paracord as a lanyard. Paracord is very strong. Someone sneaking up from behind could grab the cord and strangle the wearer rather easily. If this concerns you, you could use some weaker cord (or chain), tie a slip knot, or invest in some sort of break away device. Personally, I&#8217;m more concerned with the security of the knife around my neck (which sort of rules out slip knots) and I like the simplicity of this system. In the years that I have been carrying the Nemesis Hellion around my neck on gutted paracord, I have yet to be strangled. But it is something to be aware of &#8212; especially if you find yourself getting in a tussle fairly frequently. Do remember, though, that the paracord around you neck is attached to a knife, and knives <em>cut things</em>.</p>\n<h4>Front Pocket (TAD style)</h4>\n\n<p>My favorite way to carry the Izula is in one of the two front pockets that <a href="http://www.tadgear.com">Triple Aught Design</a> places on their pants. In my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2007/10/22/tad-gear-force-10-legionnaire-classic-cargo-pants/">Legionnaires</a>, I carry the knife in the left front pocket. It sits in the pocket rather securely, with only the top half of the handle exposed, leaning to the right. This allows for a very fast, right-handed cross draw. I have the paracord and cord lock setup and attached to the sheath the same as in the above neck carry option, but in this setup I&#8217;ll put the cord through the plastic D-ring above the front pocket and loop it through itself so that the sheath and knife are securely attached me. Normally, when I draw from this setup, I&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151190600/in/set-72157622790436729/">grab the handle and push against the sheath with my thumb</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150433721/in/set-72157622790436729/">popping the knife free</a>. But because the cord is attached to the D-ring, I can also just grab the handle and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151197346/in/set-72157622790436729/">yank it to my right</a>, extending the cord till it reaches its full length and pops the knife free. Personally, I feel that this is too obtuse a movement, so I prefer popping the knife free of the sheath with my thumb. If you prefer the latter option of yanking the knife, you could move the cord lock a few inches up the cord, thus shortening the distance you have to pull before fully extending the cord and popping the knife free. I will usually leave the cord lock all the way against the knots at the end of the cord and stuff the excess amount of cordage in the bottom of the same front pocket.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150429799/" title="RAT Izula Front Pocket Carry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/4150429799_7637c92206.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Front Pocket Carry" /></a>\n<h4>Side Pocket</h4></p>\n<p>As much as I prefer the above option, not all of us wear TAD pants every single day. When wearing another pair of pants, I will carry the Izula in the right side pocket, tip down. I found that most pockets are sized so that the tip of the sheath reaches the bottom of the pocket with only about the top 1/4&#8221; of the handle sticking out. Again, I keep the paracord and cord lock attached as before, with the cord lock slid all the way against the knots at the end, creating a big loop. This loop I run through my belt, guaranteeing the the sheath and knife are securely attached to me. To draw, I reach my hand in the pocket, grab the handle, and push against the sheath with my thumb, popping free the knife. I&#8217;m required to get my whole hand into the pocket to grasp the handle, which makes the knife slightly slower to draw than a folding pocket knife clipped into the same pocket (especially compared to an Emerson with the <a href="http://www.emersonknives.com/UsingWaveFeature.html">wave feature</a>, such as the Mini-Commander).</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151199562/" title="RAT Izula Side Pocket Carry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4151199562_1ef1e3fef7.jpg" width="500" height="485" alt="RAT Izula Side Pocket Carry" /></a></p>\n<p>Because the cord is attached to my belt I could just grab the handle and pull out or up, extending the cord till the knife pops free, but this is even more obtuse a movement than when drawing in the same manner from a front pocket. I&#8217;m not a fan.</p>\n<h4>Belt</h4>\n\n<p>The paracord and cord lock really become useful when you decide you want to carry the Izula on your belt. The first step is to unloop the cord from the sheath. Then remove the knot in either end of the cord so that the cord lock can be removed. Next, thread either end of the cord through the two holes in the side of the sheath and the reinstall the cord lock, retying the same knot in either end of the cord to prevent the cord lock from being removed.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150444613/" title="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2684/4150444613_eac52ac3da.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard" /></a></p>\n<p>Move the cord lock about halfway up the cord, grab a bit of the cord and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150447703/in/set-72157622790436729/">pull it through the large slit</a> opposite the two holes on the sheath. What you now have on the front of the sheath is a line of paracord crossing the top horizontally and, on the bottom, the cord coming together horizontally to the cord lock. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150449563/in/set-72157622790436729/">On the back of the sheath</a> you have two vertical loops that you can thread your belt through.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150451651/" title="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2517/4150451651_e4552a79c8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Belt Carry Lanyard" /></a></p>\n<p>With the sheath attached to your belt, you can then move the cord lock tight against the sheath, pulling as much paracord through the lock as you can. The Izula will then be mounted on your belt.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150453455/" title="RAT Izula Belt Carry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2784/4150453455_138175072d.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="RAT Izula Belt Carry" /></a></p>\n<p>When I first saw this carry option pictured in the manual that RAT provides with the Izula, I was skeptical of using the paracord this way. I didn&#8217;t think that you could could get the paracord tight enough to eliminate any wiggling or movement. I&#8217;ve now carried the knife a good deal like this and I am perfectly happy with it. The sheath is just as secure as a sheath with a belt clip or malice clip (albeit easier to cut off). If you keep it attached to your belt consistently for a few days, the cord lock will eventually slide down a bit, loosening up the cord and causing the sheath to move a little when the knife is drawn. This can be addressed by checking the tightness of the lock once a day every time you put on your pants, which I don&#8217;t think is too much to ask.</p>\n<p>The downside to this method is that, because we&#8217;re using the same piece of paracord as we use when wearing the knife around our neck, the paracord is necessarily long. You will have 6&#8221; or so or cord dangling below the lowest point of the sheath. This would be a problem if the two ends of the cord had been tied together, forming a loop, but because they have not been tied thusly, the two ends are loose and will not get caught on anything. They don&#8217;t bother me.</p>\n<h2>Spine</h2>\n\n<p>The spine itself is .156&#8221; thick, with about 1/2&#8221; of a grooved thumb ramp at the start of the blade. I&#8217;ve never found these thumb ramps to be necessary on any knife, but they don&#8217;t get in the way, either.</p>\n<p>Initially, I found that I could not generate any sparks by sparking the spine of the Izula against a ferro rod. I know 1095 is high-carbon, so I figured it must either be the tan-colored paint that was preventing me from getting any sparks, or the corner of the spine was slightly rounded. To address both potential problems I set the spine flat on top of a coarse silicon-carbide stone and slowly ground down the first 2&#8221; from the tip. This removes the paint and squares off the edge, giving a 90 degree angle that should be ideal for striking sparks. With that change made, the Izula will throw a decent shower of sparks.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4150399103/" title="RAT Izula Spine by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/4150399103_27f730a8c3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Spine" /></a>\n<h2>Overall</h2></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been EDCing the RAT Izula for just over two months now. So far, I have been extremely impressed with the knife. Unless I am for some reason forced to carry a folder instead of a fixed blade, I doubt that I will go back to carrying the Emerson Mini-Commander. Direct comparison between a fixed blade and a folder is not exactly fair since they have both been designed with different intentions and are markedly different tools, but I find the Izula to be a superior knife. If I woke up in the zombie apocalypse, I&#8217;d much rather find the Izula in my pocket than the Mini-Commander.</p>\n<p>If you think you can get away with EDCing a fixed blade, I&#8217;d strongly urge you to consider the Izula. As I mentioned in the beginning, the $80 that RAT asks for the knife is overpriced, but it&#8217;s not hard to pick up an Izula for closer to $50, which I think is a very good value. (It&#8217;s certainly cheaper than a quality folder like an Emerson!)</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4151150936/" title="RAT Izula Neck Knife by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/4151150936_2b679b015e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="RAT Izula Neck Knife" /></a></p>'

I&#8217;ve also found that the grind and shape of the blade is not ideal for some wood-working and wilderness survival tasks. Making feather sticks with it isn&#8217;t easy.</p>'

    vellum_post_99.body = u'I ventured into Gothic Basin today, an impressive glacier carved wilderness of the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/">Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest</a>. It lies near what was once a mining area.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006541443/" title="Danger? by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3595/4006541443_39e4e804a8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Danger?" /></a>\n\nThe way to the basin begins on the old, fenced-off road into the ghost town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Cristo,_Washington">Monte Cristo</a>. This bit of trail is littered with signs warning of extreme danger, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007314964/in/set-72157622573951982/">proceed at your own risk</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006543905/in/set-72157622573951982/">hazardous materials such as aresenic in the soil</a>, balrogs, and other such frivolities. I couldn\'t see what all the fuss was about: the trail was wide, level, and well-maintained.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006550759/" title="Peaks behind the near-dry bed of the Sauk by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2595/4006550759_ec83aa53da.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Peaks behind the near-dry bed of the Sauk" /></a>\n\nAbout 1.5 miles down the road, there used to be a bridge crossing over the Sauk River, but, some time ago, the river apparently found itself unable to suffer such indignities and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007358458/in/set-72157622573951982/">washed the bridge away</a>. At this point, my path branched off and began to climb its way to the basin along trail and old mining paths. The total elevation gain along this section is about 3,000 feet spread out over a good 4 miles or so, making it a steady, but leisurely climb -- just enough to warm one\'s self up on a crisp Autumn day.\n\nThere are a number of small waterfalls that deposit their loads on the west side of the trail, allowing to the water to trickle across the path and make its way down to join the river. Earlier in the year I imagine that these crossings could be tricky, but the headwaters had frozen up by now, leaving these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007323388/in/set-72157622573951982/">mostly dry</a>. I\'ve heard that one of these such falls has been wittingly dubbed "King Kong\'s Showerbath," though I saw nothing worthy of the name.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006561783/" title="Frozen Waterfall by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2462/4006561783_39f25b1334.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Frozen Waterfall" /></a>\n\nSome of the crossings higher up had not dried completely, but instead froze while crossing the trail, leaving ice covered rocks in my way. These rocks required some scrambling up, over and around, which was made interesting by the slippery ice. (I reminded myself that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010040539_hiker11m.html">last Saturday\'s body recovery</a> had occurred only 20 miles east of here.)\n\nNear the top, I stopped to munch on some granola, raisins, and dried banana slices. I did not don any further clothing upon stopping, however, and my break was thus cut short by the chill and the desire to warm up again. After resuming my walk, I pushed on over bare rock and soon thereafter found myself at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006570503/in/set-72157622573951982/">a small tarn</a> that marked the entrance to Gothic Basin.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007339818/" title="Gothic Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2487/4007339818_8b594fb6f1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Gothic Basin" /></a>\n\nThe basin is one of the more spectacular places that I have yet found myself in. In character it bears a striking resemblance to a Gothic cathedral, but larger and grander in scope, being carved out of the mountains over centuries by the minute movements of glaciers. A temple of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007341954/in/set-72157622573951982/">rock</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006577123/" title="Chill in the Air by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/4006577123_86c1e39a11.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Chill in the Air" /></a>\n\nMy awe was quickly overtaken by another sensation: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007303858/in/set-72157622573951982/">cold</a>. The wind was strong up here, cutting through my clothing with ease. With windchill, the temperature hovered around 20 degrees Fahrenheit -- a stark contrast even to the trailhead only 3,000 feet below, which had felt more like 45-50F. I took off my pack and put on two more light layers of wool. It was still cold. The lowlands have maintained themselves around 60F thus far which has not yet given me the opportunity to <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2006/11/30/acclimatize/">acclimatize</a> to these lower temperatures. I also found that I had neglected to bring any gloves. No matter. The small tarn was partially frozen over and I wanted to make my way another half mile further across the rock to Foggy Lake to see how it was faring.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007346482/" title="Foggy Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2642/4007346482_b074c74caf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Foggy Lake" /></a>\n\nFoggy Lake proved to be moving, though I can\'t imagine that it will resist the ice much longer.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006584215/" title="Tea Brewing by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/4006584215_1b142ba699.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Tea Brewing" /></a>\n\nStanding by the cold water made me think of the packet of kukicha that I had in my pack. I had packed it, along with my old Vargo Triad XE stove, Trail Designs windscreen, and Snow Peak 700 mug. The package is not as efficient or versatile a stove as my Trail Designs Ti-Tri stove, but packs down much smaller. I often bring it on day hikes.\n\nIt was too cold for the denatured alcohol to light with a spark, so I used one of the matches from my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">EDC</a>. Even with the screen around it, the wind blew the stove out once. I relit it and used my pack as a windbreak. As the tea brewed, I jumped around in place, trying to keep warm.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007352076/" title="Kukicha by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/4007352076_10321cb5e0.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Kukicha" /></a>\n\nSoon I noticed blood on one of my finger tips: the skin had cracked from the dryness and was oozing a little bit. I tried to apply a bandage but it refused to stick. Must have something to do with the cold, I figured, and sliced off a piece of duct tape from the bit I have rolled around my Klean Kanteen. That held the bandage in place just fine.\n\nAfter the tea had steeped, I was cold enough to decide to pack up the stove and start making my way back down, drinking the tea as I went. With mug in one hand and a trekking pole in the other, I made my way back to the tarn, facing the icy south wind. Having downed the warm tea in a remarkably quick fashion, I decided to stop so that I could put the mug away and thus have one free hand to stick in my pocket to warm. I set down the pack and mug, digging around inside the pack for the small garbage bag that I carry, so that I could pack out the teabag. It was a bit tricky, not being able to feel anything due to numb fingers. In a minute, I found the garbage bag and opened it, then reached for the tea bag that was still sitting inside the mug. It had already begun to freeze to the titanium. I broke it free, tossed it in the garbage bag, and put bag and mug in the pack. I decided that things were starting to get a bit serious when I found that I had a lot of trouble closing the zippers on my pack. After donning the pack, I could stick one hand in my pocket to warm, but the other had to stay exposed to hold the trekking pole (which I needed even more on the descent than the ascent). Using the spare Buff I had in one of my pockets, I fashioned a mitten-like covering for the exposed hand which suited to block the wind. It really wasn\'t that cold out: as soon as the fingers on both hands were out of the wind, they began to rewarm.\n\nWith that addressed, I continued the descent, making my way over scoured rock and through whispering trees back to the trailhead. (I slipped once on one of those ice covered rocks near the top, coming a little too close to the side of the mountain, but arrested myself and recovered.) The ascent took 3 hours and the descent 2.5.\n\nGothic Basin certainly warrants further explorations. Visually, it is one of the most stunning areas of the Cascades. I could easily spending a week just within the small area.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007353868/" title="Foggy Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3515/4007353868_1d2fb3aeb0.jpg" width="500" height="143" alt="Foggy Lake" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>I have often thought about what I would do out here if I were stricken with a serious illness, if I broke a leg, cut myself badly or had an attack of appendicitis. Almost as quickly as the thought came, I dismissed it. Why worry about something that isn\'t? Worrying about something that might happen is not a healthy pastime. A man\'s a fool to live his life under a shadow like that.

At this point, my path branched off and began to climb its way to the basin along trail and old mining paths. The total elevation gain along this section is about 3,000 feet spread out over a good 4 miles or so, making it a steady, but leisurely climb &#8212; just enough to warm one&#8217;s self up on a crisp Autumn day.</p>\n<p>There are a number of small waterfalls that deposit their loads on the west side of the trail, allowing to the water to trickle across the path and make its way down to join the river. Earlier in the year I imagine that these crossings could be tricky, but the headwaters had frozen up by now, leaving these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007323388/in/set-72157622573951982/">mostly dry</a>. I&#8217;ve heard that one of these such falls has been wittingly dubbed &#8220;King Kong&#8217;s Showerbath,&#8221; though I saw nothing worthy of the name.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006561783/" title="Frozen Waterfall by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2462/4006561783_39f25b1334.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Frozen Waterfall" /></a></p>\n<p>Some of the crossings higher up had not dried completely, but instead froze while crossing the trail, leaving ice covered rocks in my way. These rocks required some scrambling up, over and around, which was made interesting by the slippery ice. (I reminded myself that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010040539_hiker11m.html">last Saturday&#8217;s body recovery</a> had occurred only 20 miles east of here.)</p>\n<p>Near the top, I stopped to munch on some granola, raisins, and dried banana slices. I did not don any further clothing upon stopping, however, and my break was thus cut short by the chill and the desire to warm up again. After resuming my walk, I pushed on over bare rock and soon thereafter found myself at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006570503/in/set-72157622573951982/">a small tarn</a> that marked the entrance to Gothic Basin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007339818/" title="Gothic Basin by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2487/4007339818_8b594fb6f1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Gothic Basin" /></a></p>\n<p>The basin is one of the more spectacular places that I have yet found myself in. In character it bears a striking resemblance to a Gothic cathedral, but larger and grander in scope, being carved out of the mountains over centuries by the minute movements of glaciers. A temple of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007341954/in/set-72157622573951982/">rock</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006577123/" title="Chill in the Air by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/4006577123_86c1e39a11.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Chill in the Air" /></a></p>\n<p>My awe was quickly overtaken by another sensation: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007303858/in/set-72157622573951982/">cold</a>. The wind was strong up here, cutting through my clothing with ease. With windchill, the temperature hovered around 20 degrees Fahrenheit &#8212; a stark contrast even to the trailhead only 3,000 feet below, which had felt more like 45-50F. I took off my pack and put on two more light layers of wool. It was still cold. The lowlands have maintained themselves around 60F thus far which has not yet given me the opportunity to <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2006/11/30/acclimatize/">acclimatize</a> to these lower temperatures. I also found that I had neglected to bring any gloves. No matter. The small tarn was partially frozen over and I wanted to make my way another half mile further across the rock to Foggy Lake to see how it was faring.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007346482/" title="Foggy Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2642/4007346482_b074c74caf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Foggy Lake" /></a></p>\n<p>Foggy Lake proved to be moving, though I can&#8217;t imagine that it will resist the ice much longer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4006584215/" title="Tea Brewing by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/4006584215_1b142ba699.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Tea Brewing" /></a></p>\n<p>Standing by the cold water made me think of the packet of kukicha that I had in my pack. I had packed it, along with my old Vargo Triad XE stove, Trail Designs windscreen, and Snow Peak 700 mug. The package is not as efficient or versatile a stove as my Trail Designs Ti-Tri stove, but packs down much smaller. I often bring it on day hikes.</p>\n<p>It was too cold for the denatured alcohol to light with a spark, so I used one of the matches from my <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/08/27/every-day-carry/">EDC</a>. Even with the screen around it, the wind blew the stove out once. I relit it and used my pack as a windbreak. As the tea brewed, I jumped around in place, trying to keep warm.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007352076/" title="Kukicha by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/4007352076_10321cb5e0.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Kukicha" /></a></p>\n<p>Soon I noticed blood on one of my finger tips: the skin had cracked from the dryness and was oozing a little bit. I tried to apply a bandage but it refused to stick. Must have something to do with the cold, I figured, and sliced off a piece of duct tape from the bit I have rolled around my Klean Kanteen. That held the bandage in place just fine.</p>\n<p>After the tea had steeped, I was cold enough to decide to pack up the stove and start making my way back down, drinking the tea as I went. With mug in one hand and a trekking pole in the other, I made my way back to the tarn, facing the icy south wind. Having downed the warm tea in a remarkably quick fashion, I decided to stop so that I could put the mug away and thus have one free hand to stick in my pocket to warm. I set down the pack and mug, digging around inside the pack for the small garbage bag that I carry, so that I could pack out the teabag. It was a bit tricky, not being able to feel anything due to numb fingers. In a minute, I found the garbage bag and opened it, then reached for the tea bag that was still sitting inside the mug. It had already begun to freeze to the titanium. I broke it free, tossed it in the garbage bag, and put bag and mug in the pack. I decided that things were starting to get a bit serious when I found that I had a lot of trouble closing the zippers on my pack. After donning the pack, I could stick one hand in my pocket to warm, but the other had to stay exposed to hold the trekking pole (which I needed even more on the descent than the ascent). Using the spare Buff I had in one of my pockets, I fashioned a mitten-like covering for the exposed hand which suited to block the wind. It really wasn&#8217;t that cold out: as soon as the fingers on both hands were out of the wind, they began to rewarm.</p>\n<p>With that addressed, I continued the descent, making my way over scoured rock and through whispering trees back to the trailhead. (I slipped once on one of those ice covered rocks near the top, coming a little too close to the side of the mountain, but arrested myself and recovered.) The ascent took 3 hours and the descent 2.5.</p>\n<p>Gothic Basin certainly warrants further explorations. Visually, it is one of the most stunning areas of the Cascades. I could easily spending a week just within the small area.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/4007353868/" title="Foggy Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3515/4007353868_1d2fb3aeb0.jpg" width="500" height="143" alt="Foggy Lake" /></a>\n<blockquote>I have often thought about what I would do out here if I were stricken with a serious illness, if I broke a leg, cut myself badly or had an attack of appendicitis.

Plus, most of the time when I put photos on Flickr, I create an accompanying blog post, so I wasn\'t sure that adding the Flickr feed to the mash-up was even necessary.

It received a lot of hullabaloo last year when it was officially designated. There aren\'t many trails, but the area offers much to explore.\n\nTowards the end of this spring, I took my first trip into the Wild Sky, choosing to visit Eagle Lake. The lake is only at about 4,000 feet, but winter seemed to cling to it despite the season and conditions not a thousand feet below. On this first visit, the edges of the lake were still frozen over and the surrounding meadow covered by four feet of snow. I had not learned much about the area before venturing into it and so was surprised to find an old cabin on the eastern side of the lake. It was apparently built sometime around the 1950s for the Forest Service. They\'ve since abandoned it, leaving the cabin to be maintained by locals who visit the area frequently. It houses a couple beds, wood stove, cooking implements, wood working tools, warm clothing, a bit of food, and other odds and ends that people have supplied. I spent one comfortable night in the cabin on my first visit and decided that I would like to visit the area again sometime after snow melt.\n\nEarlier this week I made a short trip to accomplish that, spending two nights in the area to celebrate the Autumnal Equinox and the equality of day and night. I had no particular goals in mind for the trip and did not intend to log much distance over the few days.\n\nIt was pleasantly uneventful.\n\nThe hike in started on a short, 2-mile trail to Barclay Lake. I was surprised at how dry the lake had become since my previous visit. The lake looked to hold only half as much water as before, exposing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953851021/">logs and boulders on one end</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953853275/">a grassy meadow on the other</a>. Baring Mountain still towered above the area, sunning its harsh, 3,000 foot northern face.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953854733/" title="Baring Mountain by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/3953854733_1517f03e87.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Baring Mountain" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nFrom Barclay, I left the trail and made my way north up a ridge to the small -- and seemingly always extraordinarily cold -- Stone Lake. After Stone Lake, I headed northwest a short distance through Paradise Meadow to my destination of Eagle Lake, all told only another 2 miles from Barclay.\n\nThe way from Stone Lake to Eagle Lake through Paradise Meadow was a much easier and more pleasant jaunt with a good covering of snow on the ground. Now, the meadow was a muddy bog that warranted careful attention be paid to each footstep, lest I find my boots submerged in mud. I was glad that I had not decided to come back to the area in July or August, as the meadow looked a perfect place for bugs. (Indeed, I thought to myself that Paradise Meadow was probably named by mosquitoes.) As it was, the year had aged enough that there were no biting insects about. But for that fact and the shortness of the day, it could easily have been midsummer. The skies were clear, the country green, and temperatures somewhere around 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3954644836/" title="Merchant Peak and Eagle Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2632/3954644836_020f0ccfff.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Merchant Peak and Eagle Lake" /></a>\n\nArriving at the lake at mid-afternoon, I reported to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3954646956/">the cabin</a> and found it all in good order. But the day was warm and the night promised to be clear. I could find no reason to spend it in a box. So I left the cabin and found a well suited site for my tarp on the shore of the lake, a ways down from the cabin. The remainder of the afternoon and evening was spent with hatchet, knife, and saw, preparing the first fire of the season and kindling the blaze against the coming darker months.\n\nThat night, I cooked a small dinner on the fire, enjoyed the flame, and went to bed.\n\nI slept in late the next morning, not crawling out of my sleeping bag till 9:30 AM. It looked to be another fine day. It was supposed to be the first day of Fall, but this country didn\'t know it yet.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3954642604/" title="Camp at Eagle Lake by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2596/3954642604_eb75b7664c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Camp at Eagle Lake" /></a>\n\nAfter breakfast, I lounged around the lake, explored the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953868663/">neighboring ridges</a> and some more of the meadow. Near 1 PM, I thought about where I would like to spend the night. Initially I had thought that I would spend it at Eagle Lake once more, either in the cabin or in another spot near the lake, but this trip marked the second time I had walked past Barclay Lake without much of a pause there. It had always seemed a nice spot to me, despite its close proximity to the trailhead. There would be little chance of encountering many people at Barclay, it being the middle of the week and summer now over. I decided I would try a night down there.\n\nWorking my way back down to Barclay was a sweaty affair. I encouraged myself along the way by thinking that I could jump in the lake to wash and cool off at the end of it. When I finally made my way back down and arrived at Barclay it was still plenty light, but I was disappointed to find that the sun had already gone behind Baring Mountain. No matter, I thought, and, stripping down to my underwear, jumped in. It was cold. Cold enough to make me think it a surprise that there wasn\'t any ice on the surface. My time in the lake was shorter than I had previously expected.\n\nI had already laid out my nice, warm, merino wool baselayers before jumping in, and eagerly put them on after drying off. The lake had left me feeling refreshed, and I went off to find a suitable spot to hang my tarp for the night. I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3954651104/">cooked and ate dinner</a> as the land darkened. Just before dusk I heard a strange sound and looked up in time to see a chute open. Two people had jumped off the top of Baring and para-glided down to the meadow on the eastern side of the lake. Soon after, I retreated to bed and went off to another satisfying sleep.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953872801/" title="Barclay Lake Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3500/3953872801_d411d3acaf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Barclay Lake Camp" /></a>\n\nNext morning I woke up early, but stayed in my sleeping bag reading till around 9. It was another slow morning, with not much of anything occurring besides breakfast. Laying on the beach of the lake just before noon I spotted a small wisp of cloud in the west. It was creeping in on an otherwise spotless sky. No more than 15 minutes later, the valley was filled with fog. Fall had finally arrived, I thought, and took that as my cue to break camp and head off back to the trailhead.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3954656070/" title="Clouds Obscure Baring by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3954656070_4efd516a3b.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Clouds Obscure Baring" /></a>'

Baring Mountain still towered above the area, sunning its harsh, 3,000 foot northern face.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3953854733/" title="Baring Mountain by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3502/3953854733_1517f03e87.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Baring Mountain" /></a>\n</p>'

    vellum_post_108.body = u'Last week I planned a loop through (and around) the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/recreation-nu/wilderness_1.shtml#buck">Buckhorn Wilderness</a> of Olympic National Forest. My <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/07/06/a-night-at-buckhorn/">previous visit</a> had only provided a glimpse of the many mountains and valleys, all of which demanded further exploration. The loop was about 30 miles, which I thought I\'d split into 3 or 4 leisurely days, allowing time for side trips and naps.\n\nI entered the forest at the same trail head as before and climbed the same trail up to Marmot Pass.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3924064096/" title="Marmot Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3924064096_9fa6af356a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Marmot Pass" /></a>\n\nI had arrived at the trail head later than intended, so it was already late-afternoon by the time I had made the climb to the top. My intended camp for the night, Home Lake, was another 5 miles (and 1,000 feet down, then 1,000 feet up) away, which I thought I could still easily make before dusk.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nA couple miles down from the pass, I arrived at an area marked on the map as Boulder Camp: an open field with a stream running through it. I thought it would make a fine camp, but I had heard that Home Lake was a popular backcountry destination, and I wanted to see why.\n\nAs I continued down the trail, I thought about which of my meals I would fix up for dinner that night, and enjoyed the scenery of the forest. I was startled out of my serenity by a sign on the side of the trail informing me that I was entering Olympic National Park. Oops. Apparently I had not studied my map closely enough while planning the trip. I had no intention of leaving the National Forest, and certainly had not meant to cross the Park boundary. Without a permit from the National Park Service, it would be illegal for me to spend the night at Home Lake. Oh well, I thought. On the off chance that I met anyone official along the trail, I\'ll just pull out the "I-used-to-do-backcountry-trail-patrol-for-the-NPS-too!" trick out of my hat and play on their sense of camaraderie.\n\nAs it turned out, I encountered no person along the trail that day and arrived at the Lake just as the sun set behind the westerly peaks. With the sky lit up red, I put on my long underwear and jacket and enjoyed a meal to end the fine day. The sky looked clear, with small chance of rain, so I left my tarp in my pack. A sleeping pad and bag in a clearing above the lake would be my home for the night. After hanging my food in a stand of trees beyond the camp, I settled into the bag and fell asleep watching the stars slowly pass by overhead. I was awoken once that night to the sound of rocks falling down the flank of neighboring Mount Constance. Satisfied to have been witness to the changing of the Earth, I slept once more.\n\nWaking with the sun, I quickly broke my small camp and started on the trail back to Boulder Camp, from where I would take another trail that would continue my loop. Halfway back, I stopped at a waterfall for water and a small breakfast. Mid-morning found me back at Boulder Camp.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923285185/" title="Mid-Morning at Boulder Camp by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3448/3923285185_0eb9d6fe15.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mid-Morning at Boulder Camp" /></a>\n\nThe rest of the morning was consumed by walking along the trail down into the valley carved by the upper reaches of the Dungeness River. Shortly after noon I arrived at a fine spot along the river with a rocky beach and an open field beyond. With no other demands on my time, I cooled my feet in river, fixed a lunch, and napped under the bright sun.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923296133/" title="Dungeness River at Camp Handy by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/3923296133_cf9b46216e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Dungeness River at Camp Handy" /></a>\n\nI had no planned campsite that night, intending instead to simply stop wherever I happened to be when the sun set. The rest of the day\'s walk was easy going, not gaining or losing much elevation, along a trail and, at the end, a bit of an old Forest Service road. At the end of the dirt road I picked up the trail that would complete the loop. Soon thereafter I came upon a clearing and a shelter on the side of the trail.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923361819/" title="Shelter near Copper Creek by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3488/3923361819_852002aba2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Shelter near Copper Creek" /></a>\n\nThe day was close to its end. I decided to camp near the shelter for the night. As the sun set, the sky slowly filled up with clouds, hinting at the possibility of rain that night. I decided I would place my pad and bag in front of the shelter, so as to enjoy once again what stars shone through the breaks in the clouds, but have a retreat close by in case rain did fall.\n\nSleep found me quickly once again that night, and I snoozed comfortably until the pleasant pitter-patter of water entered my dreams. Some conscious part of my brain recognized the sound as rain and waged a difficult battle to wake up the rest of my body enough to quickly move my bedroll under the shelter\'s roof. Afterward, I slept soundly again until morning. Fog had filled up the valley overnight, blocking the sun\'s wakeful rays and encouraging me to sleep well into the morning. Eventually I woke and completed the morning rituals of gathering water, retrieving my food bag, and cooking a breakfast.\n\nOn the trail again, I walked through the mist shrouded valley, wondering if the previous day had been the year\'s last day of summer weather.\n\nThe day\'s walk along the last part of the loop should have been a simple affair. It was on a trail, requiring no effort of navigation of my part, and close enough to the area around Buckhorn Mountain that I had scouted last time that I thought I could probably find my way without trail or much use of map or compass if I had to.\n\nAround noon on that third day, I arrived at a fork in the trail. From looking at the map, I had expected a fork, but not for another mile or two. No matter, I thought, I have probably just been walking a bit faster than I thought. I took the right fork, which should have continued along the main trail back to Marmot Pass. The fork went slightly uphill for about a hundred feet and immediately entered a clearing in the trees. Trails, being rather fickle by nature, are often hard to mark when going from dense woods into a wide clearing. This right fork disappeared immediately on the boundary. I walked the perimeter of the clearing, thinking that I would pick up the trail again on the other side. To my surprise, I did not find what looked to be the main trail, but half a dozen smaller trails going off every which way instead. I explored them all and discovered that they had a disturbing habit of petering out into nothing very shortly after leaving the clearing. Deciding then that this right fork of the trail must not be the fork marked on my map, I backtracked to the junction and took the left fork. This trail also disappeared shortly after the junction, compounding my confusion.\n\nI saw the sun poking through the fog and clouds a bit and decided to head back to the clearing down the right fork so as to enjoy the warmth and see if I could discover where I was. Setting my pack down beside a rock, I dug out my GPS, turned it on, and set it aside to acquire a satellite signal. Then I took the map out of my pocket and, judging from my gut feeling of my pace and length of time on the move, reckoned roughly where I thought I should be. Pulling out my compass, I attempted to get a bearing and corroborate the opinion of my location. The compass agreed with me, but, even though I was in a clearing, I was still down in the middle of a deep valley stuffed full of old growth forest and so had a difficult time getting an accurate bearing on any landmark with my compass. Still, at the very least I was comfortable of knowing that I was somewhere in a 100 meter box on the map. The GPS had acquired its signal by this time and was displaying my coordinates. I never put much faith in the device and generally refrain from using it for navigation as it has proved at times to be wildly inaccurate, but the coordinates it displayed agreed with my previous findings. Everything pointed to myself being where I was supposed to be. I was found, but the trail was most definitely lost.\n\nNeither the right nor left fork of the trail had any evidence of continuing after the junction. The right fork had a small creek running along its western side, which matched the map, but the left fork also had a small creek, this one along its eastern edge, that was not supposed to exist. The creek along the right fork looked slightly larger. I reasoned that the left fork\'s creek might be a new comer in the area and so not represented on my map. I knew that the trail that I was supposed to be following should follow a creek up to a lake. It seemed likely that this creek along the right fork of the trail was most likely the one that drained the lake. I thought I would try to follow it to the lake, from where the main trail should once again become obvious.\n\nThis planned proved well for the first hundred feet or so, but I was soon defeated by the valley. Increasingly dense plant life crowded around the stream, with frequent boulders and massive downed trees blocked my way. Without the large pack on my back, I might have attempted to continue, but, as it was, I did not think that attempting to climb, crawl, and push my way along the creek was a realistic or overly wise notion.\n\nAccepting defeat, I sat down, pulled out the map once more, and considered my options. I knew that I could backtrack the entire loop, retracing my footsteps of the whole trip and come out that way. Another two days to do that, I figured. I had enough food to complete that with no lack of comfort, but the option did not appeal to me.\n\nI also knew that I could make my way back down to the Forest Service road that I had used to make up part of the loop, and make my way out to the highway. But I had no guarantee that there would be anyone at all on this road to give me a lift and I judged that the road took about 45 miles to wind its way out of the forest. A worse option than the previous, this did not appeal to me either.\n\nI was still not entirely convinced that this fork in the trail that was troubling me was not the same fork marked on the map. Looking at the map, I saw that after the split, the right fork made a couple rather wide switchbacks up to the top of the western ridge. Judging from where I thought I was, I reasoned that I could simply walk straight west up the slope and intersect the main trail. It was a steep climb, and proved my plan easier said than done.\n\nA third of the way up, I decided to drop my pack and continue up less encumbered. The thick forest had ended up here, giving way to tall grasses and rocks, which made the going easier, but also completely hid my pack from view after I set it on the ground. I walked up a little higher, turned around, and did my best to make a mental picture of the area, hoping that I could find my way back to my pack on the way down.\n\nContinuing up the slope (much faster than before) I resumed my search, but was discouraged when I failed to find the main trail. I thought I had gone far enough, but decided to travel up just a little bit further to make sure that I did not miss it. Slightly higher, I found a narrow channel cut through the grass. It looked like something made by the local goats. I was sure that it could not be the trail that I was looking for, but it ran in roughly the direction that I wished to go and was surely the path of least resistance. Deciding that I would see where it led, I went back down the slope to get my pack (which I found with little trouble). Then, back up again to the goat trail.\n\nThe small path continued to travel in the correct direction and was much easier than walking through the thick valley below. My spirits began to improve, but I was dismayed once more when the path split. Another fork! One path continued on, roughly in the same direction, while the other went up steeply and shortly disappeared from view. I had no idea which to take, but chose to climb the higher one. I would see where that one went, I thought, and, from up there, ought to be able to see where the lower path went as well. The decision proved well. After climbing the higher fork only a short distance, I saw above me what could only be the main trail. Wide, well maintained, and even defined on the edges by an old log here and there. I hurried onto the trail and continued on my way. In all, I had only been misplaced for about 2 hours.\n\nThe main trail climbed high to the top of ridges, well above tree line, where the ground was covered only by rocks and the occasional hardy moss and lichens. In this sort of terrain, it\'s difficult to mark out a trail, and I ended up losing it now and again. This didn\'t worry me. Unlike when I lost the trail down in the valley, up here I was able to see where I was going and easily make my way along my own path.\n\nGiving up on the trail, which became only more and more faint as I went on, I marked what looked to be Marmot Pass and made my way towards it. The distance was not great, but it was steep. For some nonsensical reason, whenever I make my way cross country, I always choose a line as straight as possible, avoiding any switchbacks. It makes for a shorter overall distance, but a much more difficult climb. I did not much mind, as the views of the alpine environment made up for the difficulty of the hike.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923377923/" title="Looking South by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2504/3923377923_dfb24ceebb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Looking South" /></a>\n\nBelow me, I could see to one side the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923371479/in/set-72157622379867926/">fog over the Dungeness River valley</a> that I had walked in the day before.

I looked around and muttered to myself that this looked suspiciously like Buckhorn Mountain. In fact, I decided, it <em>was</em> Buckhorn Moutain. I had no intention of coming up here this trip and so had climbed a good thousand feet higher than I needed to. Oops. I looked down to the pass, and, with a sigh, began my descent.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3924165588/" title="Looking Down to Marmot Pass by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2478/3924165588_ae34f0ea19.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Looking Down to Marmot Pass" /></a>\n\nBelow me, I could see that the way down to the trail head, along with most the rest of the region, was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3924167886/in/set-72157622379867926/">covered by cloud</a>. I marched on and, despite the day\'s misadventures, found the end of the trail just before the sun began to set on the third day.'

Without the large pack on my back, I might have attempted to continue, but, as it was, I did not think that attempting to climb, crawl, and push my way along the creek was a realistic or overly wise notion.</p>\n<p>Accepting defeat, I sat down, pulled out the map once more, and considered my options. I knew that I could backtrack the entire loop, retracing my footsteps of the whole trip and come out that way. Another two days to do that, I figured. I had enough food to complete that with no lack of comfort, but the option did not appeal to me.</p>\n<p>I also knew that I could make my way back down to the Forest Service road that I had used to make up part of the loop, and make my way out to the highway. But I had no guarantee that there would be anyone at all on this road to give me a lift and I judged that the road took about 45 miles to wind its way out of the forest. A worse option than the previous, this did not appeal to me either.</p>\n<p>I was still not entirely convinced that this fork in the trail that was troubling me was not the same fork marked on the map. Looking at the map, I saw that after the split, the right fork made a couple rather wide switchbacks up to the top of the western ridge. Judging from where I thought I was, I reasoned that I could simply walk straight west up the slope and intersect the main trail. It was a steep climb, and proved my plan easier said than done.</p>\n<p>A third of the way up, I decided to drop my pack and continue up less encumbered. The thick forest had ended up here, giving way to tall grasses and rocks, which made the going easier, but also completely hid my pack from view after I set it on the ground. I walked up a little higher, turned around, and did my best to make a mental picture of the area, hoping that I could find my way back to my pack on the way down.</p>\n<p>Continuing up the slope (much faster than before) I resumed my search, but was discouraged when I failed to find the main trail. I thought I had gone far enough, but decided to travel up just a little bit further to make sure that I did not miss it. Slightly higher, I found a narrow channel cut through the grass. It looked like something made by the local goats. I was sure that it could not be the trail that I was looking for, but it ran in roughly the direction that I wished to go and was surely the path of least resistance. Deciding that I would see where it led, I went back down the slope to get my pack (which I found with little trouble). Then, back up again to the goat trail.</p>\n<p>The small path continued to travel in the correct direction and was much easier than walking through the thick valley below. My spirits began to improve, but I was dismayed once more when the path split. Another fork! One path continued on, roughly in the same direction, while the other went up steeply and shortly disappeared from view. I had no idea which to take, but chose to climb the higher one. I would see where that one went, I thought, and, from up there, ought to be able to see where the lower path went as well. The decision proved well. After climbing the higher fork only a short distance, I saw above me what could only be the main trail. Wide, well maintained, and even defined on the edges by an old log here and there. I hurried onto the trail and continued on my way. In all, I had only been misplaced for about 2 hours.</p>\n<p>The main trail climbed high to the top of ridges, well above tree line, where the ground was covered only by rocks and the occasional hardy moss and lichens. In this sort of terrain, it&#8217;s difficult to mark out a trail, and I ended up losing it now and again. This didn&#8217;t worry me. Unlike when I lost the trail down in the valley, up here I was able to see where I was going and easily make my way along my own path.</p>\n<p>Giving up on the trail, which became only more and more faint as I went on, I marked what looked to be Marmot Pass and made my way towards it. The distance was not great, but it was steep. For some nonsensical reason, whenever I make my way cross country, I always choose a line as straight as possible, avoiding any switchbacks. It makes for a shorter overall distance, but a much more difficult climb. I did not much mind, as the views of the alpine environment made up for the difficulty of the hike.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923377923/" title="Looking South by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2504/3923377923_dfb24ceebb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Looking South" /></a></p>\n<p>Below me, I could see to one side the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3923371479/in/set-72157622379867926/">fog over the Dungeness River valley</a> that I had walked in the day before.

I had been back from a week in the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/uma/recreation/wilderness.shtml#wtw">Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness</a> of the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/uma/">Umatilla National Forest</a> for only a few days, but having had a shower, a shave, and done some laundry, I was ready to head back out again. I planned to go there on Saturday, when the rest of the country would be eating hot dogs and preparing to blow stuff up in celebration of the violent overthrow of a government (being <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8129184.stm">too fat</a>, no doubt, for a more fitting remembrance, such as staring a local militia movement.)\n\nAssuming that the traffic would be poor and the ferry to the peninsula jammed because of the holiday, I awoke early and hit the road as the sun came up. As it turned out, there was almost no traffic and I only had a 5 or 10 minute wait for the ferry.\n\nThe ferry ride from <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/info_desk/terminals/index.cfm?terminal_id=8">Edmonds</a> to <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/info_desk/terminals/index.cfm?terminal_id=12">Kingston</a> on the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/your_wsf/our_fleet/index.cfm?vessel_id=25">Puyallup</a> is a short, 25 minute cruise. I entertained myself by taking pictures from the bow as the mountains appeared.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695243007/" title="The Olympics in the Distance by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3695243007_a8bb32b0a2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The Olympics in the Distance" /></a>\n\nFrom Kingston, it was another short journey to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=&vps=1&jsv=165c&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=30.544155,68.730469&ie=UTF8&geocode=Faq92QId5hCt-A&split=0">Quilcene</a>, where I left the highway for <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/">the forest</a>.\n\nAt the trailhead, I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696054562/in/set-72157620919897531/">loaded up my gear</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696054938/in/set-72157620919897531/">glanced over the notices</a>, and signed in at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696055872/in/set-72157620919897531/">the register</a>, entering the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/recreation-nu/wilderness_1.shtml#buck">Buckhorn Wilderness</a> at about 12:30 PM.\n\nThe hike to the pass is short and fairly leisurely, being only 5 miles and gaining 3,600 feet. It is an easy day hike and, it being a holiday, I was worried about the area being too crowded for my taste. Things were looking up on the way in, as the only people I saw were day hikers walking out.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696056428/" title="The Quilcene River by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/3696056428_c15410f9e8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The Quilcene River" /></a>\n\nThe trail follows the Quilcene River for the first few miles, wandering through a dense forest of Doug Fir, Cedar, and Hemlock. Halfway in, the trail passes through a cleared area that must be Shelter Rock Camp. It is empty, which is a good sign, but not surprising. I cannot think why anyone would want to camp so close to the trailhead.\n\nBeyond Shelter Rock, the trail begins to climb. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695248167/in/set-72157620919897531/">The forest clears for a spell</a>, exposing the first views of the peaks of the Olympics. I pass a couple of day hikers going in, picking their way along slowly despite not having any weight on their backs. After them, I come upon a group of 4 backpackers plodding along the trail. Judging by the size of their packs, they must have a month\'s worth of provisions. As I pass them, the trail turns a corner. I am greeted by the second and last established camp on the trail, Camp Mystery. My heart sinks. It is the most depressing sight I could think of: a veritable village here in the wilderness.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695249343/" title="The Village at Camp Mystery by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2426/3695249343_af7dfc3677.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The Village at Camp Mystery" /></a>\n\nOver a dozen tents and more people crammed together, crowding both sides of the trail. I look to the trees and a cringe of embarrassment for these people runs through me. Everywhere, branches are laden with stuff sacks. Bear bags, they must be, but not one is hung more than six feet from the ground. Most are closer to 5 feet, hung near the trunks, where strong branches meet the tree.

Where before I had only seen a few small peaks of the Cascades, far off in the distance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier">Mt.

I find myself walking along the spine of the mountain, covered here with rocks and there with more meadows of flowers and grass. There is one tent with two people right off the trail. I congratulate them on their choice of bedroom. I go further, to the top of the summit, glad to have left the insanity a thousand feet below me. From up here, I can see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_Canal">Hood Canal</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound">Puget Sound</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Islands">San Juan Islands</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett,_Washington">Everett</a>, Rainier and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Peak">Glacier Peak</a>.

This place and this view brings into strict contrast, particularly, California. Down there they have seen fit to trade all good clean air for smog and pollution. Looking west from the peaks of the Sierra Nevada it is not possible to see even into the foothills, much less the neighboring coast range. It is a lamentable development, to have had to sacrifice Oregon as a buffer state between us and them, but I hope it will give us the time needed to protect and preserve our own realm.\n\nBack here, on top of the mountain, I feel dehydration setting in -- a tingling in my fingers. The day has been hot, the climb long. It is cooler up here, but also that much closer to the Sun. I had drunk the last of my 2 liters of water near Camp Mystery. I need something to drink now and more still if I plan to spend the night up here. But there is no water on the back of the mountain. So, I begin the climb down again. In an hour, I reach the meadows just above Camp Mystery and find a spot where a low but fast moving spring gurgles out of the Earth. There is probably no need to filter it, but I do. I sit for a while, slowly sipping a liter of water. Then I top off my bladder and bottle, giving me about 3 liters for the night. Tossing on the (now much heavier) pack, I turn around, and climb back up to the pass, then back up the mountain, reaching the summit again in another hour and a half.\n\nNow, at the top, I survey the area for a spot to pitch my tarp. I spot a small saddle back along the spine of the mountain, just below the main summit and out of sight from the other camp. The ground looks rocky, but that\'s why I brought a sleeping pad.\n\nI clear away a few of the larger rocks and pitched the tarp there, opening facing east, as I always do, to catch the first warming rays of dawn.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695257761/" title="Setting Sun by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3545/3695257761_a40a2b72d4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Setting Sun" /></a>\n\nThat done, I wander around a bit, exploring the area.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695256645/" title="Lazy Evening by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2564/3695256645_9291c61c2d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Lazy Evening" /></a>\n\n I am particularly interested to find an outcropping of boulders with many loose rocks. Originally, I had intended to spend the night at or just below the pass, which is situated at just about the tree line. As such, I had brought my bear bag hanging system to store food. Up here it is alpine. There are no trees available. In this outcrop of rocks, I can at least bury my bag. Of course, any rock that I can move, a bear can move with much more ease, but it is the best that I can do. All my food is individually packaged in ziploc bags, all of which are in an odor proof <a href="http://www.loksak.com/products/opsak">Opsak</a>, which is itself in a stuff sack. It seems pretty scent-proof. As long as I cook and eat all my food in another spot away from camp, I see no reason why any bear would venture up this high to disturb me -- particularly not with the buffet awaiting him down at Camp Mystery. As well, I am on National Forest land, not National Park. One of the benefits of National Forests is that dogs are allowed. The other camp further back along the spine of the mountain has a dog with them. Coming up the mountain from that direction is the most likely route for anyone, bear or human. The dog would be an excellent sentry, warning me of any intruders.\n\nI cook my dinner and stash my food. It was about 9:00 PM now and I was just thinking that this place would be worthy of an annual pilgrimage, whether fireworks were visible or not, when I caught sight of some motion to my left. I turn, looking towards the steep southern slope of the mountain and saw something white. I am stunned for a moment. I am used to the browns of deer, elk, and cougars and the black of bears (no Grizzly out here), but white? Recovering, I realize what it is. A Mountain Goat. For myself, the very spirit of the mountains. But so rare to see. I rush back to my tarp, bend down, with my back to where he had appeared, and grab the camera out of my pack. Turning around, I half expect him to have vanished. But he had not. He was only a few feet from my tarp, and approaching.\n\n<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=059fc38c38&photo_id=3695242767"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=059fc38c38&photo_id=3695242767" height="300" width="400"></embed></object></div>\n\nOut of myth, out of time, the great god Pan walks towards me. In shock of his lack of fear, I can only stand, pointing my lens towards him. For a moment or for an eternity, I am set loose from the fetters of the profanity below. The human world is shattered by his presence. He looks at me, and I find myself at once in another place. Older, wider, and deeper. There is no other sound here, above all things, and he is close enough for me to hear his breath.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696104074/" title="Mountain Goat by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2533/3696104074_c10db1e777.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mountain Goat" /></a>\n\nHe leads on, and I follow. I try not to make much noise, but he, casting an eye at me over his shoulder now and again, is aware of my presence. We walk in the light of the setting sun for a time. At the top of a small rise beyond my camp, I stop, and allow him to continue alone. The sun has set now, leaving the western sky a blood red. But rising in the east is a full moon. It will not be dark tonight.\n\nReaching my tarp once again, I can see the lights of the cities far away -- isolated attempts to drive back the night and the cycles of the world. It is near 10:00 PM now. The fireworks begin. Tiny explosion of red and white along the coast in an endless stream from Everett to Seattle. Soundless flashes of light. I wonder what a war would look like from up here.\n\nIt is night now. I crawl under the tarp, into my sleeping bag. Lying on my stomach, looking out from under my shelter, I can still see all the explosions. They are not as impressive as the rest of this world. I quickly lose interest and turn onto my back to go to sleep.\n\nPerhaps half an hour later, I hear movement out to the south. Pan walks by, three or four feet in front of my bed. His gait is quicker now, eager to return to his own bed after completing his business.\n\nIn the morning, I am awakened by the sun. Clouds are in the sky. There is a wind blowing across the mountain.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696117812/" title="East by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3597/3696117812_4de958590f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="East" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696113410/" title="Cloudy Morning by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2600/3696113410_c6bff7d443.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cloudy Morning" /></a>\n\nI go to where I buried my food and, finding it unmolested, return with it to camp.

    vellum_post_116.body_rendered = u'<p>I first heard of the hike to Marmot Pass through <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes-of-the-week/marmot-pass">a report at the Washington Trails Association</a>, which claimed that it was possible to see Seattle&#8217;s Fourth of July fireworks from the pass.

I planned to go there on Saturday, when the rest of the country would be eating hot dogs and preparing to blow stuff up in celebration of the violent overthrow of a government (being <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8129184.stm">too fat</a>, no doubt, for a more fitting remembrance, such as staring a local militia movement.)</p>\n<p>Assuming that the traffic would be poor and the ferry to the peninsula jammed because of the holiday, I awoke early and hit the road as the sun came up.

Judging by the size of their packs, they must have a month&#8217;s worth of provisions. As I pass them, the trail turns a corner.

The ground looks rocky, but that&#8217;s why I brought a sleeping pad.</p>\n<p>I clear away a few of the larger rocks and pitched the tarp there, opening facing east, as I always do, to catch the first warming rays of dawn.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695257761/" title="Setting Sun by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3545/3695257761_a40a2b72d4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Setting Sun" /></a></p>\n<p>That done, I wander around a bit, exploring the area.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3695256645/" title="Lazy Evening by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2564/3695256645_9291c61c2d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Lazy Evening" /></a></p>\n<p>I am particularly interested to find an outcropping of boulders with many loose rocks. Originally, I had intended to spend the night at or just below the pass, which is situated at just about the tree line. As such, I had brought my bear bag hanging system to store food. Up here it is alpine. There are no trees available. In this outcrop of rocks, I can at least bury my bag. Of course, any rock that I can move, a bear can move with much more ease, but it is the best that I can do. All my food is individually packaged in ziploc bags, all of which are in an odor proof <a href="http://www.loksak.com/products/opsak">Opsak</a>, which is itself in a stuff sack. It seems pretty scent-proof. As long as I cook and eat all my food in another spot away from camp, I see no reason why any bear would venture up this high to disturb me &#8212; particularly not with the buffet awaiting him down at Camp Mystery. As well, I am on National Forest land, not National Park. One of the benefits of National Forests is that dogs are allowed. The other camp further back along the spine of the mountain has a dog with them. Coming up the mountain from that direction is the most likely route for anyone, bear or human. The dog would be an excellent sentry, warning me of any intruders.</p>\n<p>I cook my dinner and stash my food. It was about 9:00 PM now and I was just thinking that this place would be worthy of an annual pilgrimage, whether fireworks were visible or not, when I caught sight of some motion to my left. I turn, looking towards the steep southern slope of the mountain and saw something white. I am stunned for a moment. I am used to the browns of deer, elk, and cougars and the black of bears (no Grizzly out here), but white? Recovering, I realize what it is. A Mountain Goat. For myself, the very spirit of the mountains. But so rare to see. I rush back to my tarp, bend down, with my back to where he had appeared, and grab the camera out of my pack. Turning around, I half expect him to have vanished. But he had not. He was only a few feet from my tarp, and approaching.</p>\n<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=059fc38c38&amp;photo_id=3695242767"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=059fc38c38&amp;photo_id=3695242767" height="300" width="400"></embed></object></div>\n\n<p>Out of myth, out of time, the great god Pan walks towards me. In shock of his lack of fear, I can only stand, pointing my lens towards him. For a moment or for an eternity, I am set loose from the fetters of the profanity below. The human world is shattered by his presence. He looks at me, and I find myself at once in another place. Older, wider, and deeper. There is no other sound here, above all things, and he is close enough for me to hear his breath.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696104074/" title="Mountain Goat by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2533/3696104074_c10db1e777.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Mountain Goat" /></a></p>\n<p>He leads on, and I follow. I try not to make much noise, but he, casting an eye at me over his shoulder now and again, is aware of my presence. We walk in the light of the setting sun for a time. At the top of a small rise beyond my camp, I stop, and allow him to continue alone. The sun has set now, leaving the western sky a blood red. But rising in the east is a full moon. It will not be dark tonight.</p>\n<p>Reaching my tarp once again, I can see the lights of the cities far away &#8212; isolated attempts to drive back the night and the cycles of the world. It is near 10:00 PM now. The fireworks begin. Tiny explosion of red and white along the coast in an endless stream from Everett to Seattle. Soundless flashes of light. I wonder what a war would look like from up here.</p>\n<p>It is night now. I crawl under the tarp, into my sleeping bag. Lying on my stomach, looking out from under my shelter, I can still see all the explosions. They are not as impressive as the rest of this world. I quickly lose interest and turn onto my back to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Perhaps half an hour later, I hear movement out to the south. Pan walks by, three or four feet in front of my bed. His gait is quicker now, eager to return to his own bed after completing his business.</p>\n<p>In the morning, I am awakened by the sun. Clouds are in the sky. There is a wind blowing across the mountain.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696117812/" title="East by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3597/3696117812_4de958590f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="East" /></a>\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3696113410/" title="Cloudy Morning by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2600/3696113410_c6bff7d443.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cloudy Morning" /></a></p>\n<p>I go to where I buried my food and, finding it unmolested, return with it to camp.

The following is outdated, but left for posterity.)</p>\n\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyvek">Tyvek</a> is a synthetic material made by DuPont, most regularly used at construction sites for wrapping house frames. It is a rather strong material and fairly waterproof. It is so ubiqitous in industrial usage as to be freely available to the intrepid individual. Partly because of this, Tyvek is popular among many lightweight travelers for use as a cheap, lightweight, and effective groundcloth for a tarp shelter.\n\nThe United States Postal Service\'s Priority Mail envelopes are also made out of the material. A few months ago I saw a picture of one of these envelopes in use as a stuff sack. I thought it was a great idea and decided to make my own. I\'ve since made two of them. It\'s a very simple process.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652264681/" title="The Supplies by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2432/3652264681_7cb27d13ef.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The Supplies" /></a>\n\nYou need only a few items for the project: a USPS Priority Mail envelope, a needle and thread (from the repair kit in your <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2009/06/07/possibles-pouch/">trusty possibles pouch</a>, no doubt), a bit of cord, a cordlock, and a sharp object. You could make the needed cuts with a knife, but scissors are a bit easier. I use the pair on my Leatherman Juice S2, which has replaced the Charge ALX as my daily carry.\n\nThe envelope can be new or used. Any post office will have new envelopes available in the lobby, free for the taking. Still, I would feel a little guilty about taking a brand new envelope just for this purpose. There\'s plenty enough used envelopes floating around, and it seems a waste to steal a brand new one. I lucked out in that recently someone sent me a package in a box, but, within the box, used the pictured envelope to organize the goods. So the envelope is used, but brand new.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3653071086/" title="Federal Offense by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3615/3653071086_125dddb6b8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Federal Offense" /></a>\n\nThis project also warrants a disclaimer: Priority Mail envelopes, whether new or used, are <em>property of the United States Postal Service</em>. They are intended solely for the use of the postal system and, contrary to logic, just because somebody paid to mail you a package in one doesn\'t make it yours (or theirs). So repurposing the envelope in this way is probably a federal offense. Law abiding citizens should immediately navigate away from this page and return to their cells. The rest of us can move on.\n\nThe first step in the process is to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3653062264/in/set-72157620193065231/">cut a little square in one corner of the open end of the envelope</a>. No need to measure. Just eyeball whatever looks good. The height of the square will determine the size of the channel which we will sew and then pass the cord through (this one happened to be about 1.5mm).\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652266641/" title="The Corner by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2483/3652266641_ecb5867995.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The Corner" /></a>\n\nIf you are using a brand new envelope, you\'ll want to cut the top bit with the sticky stuff off, so that both sides of the envelope are the same height. On a used envelope, you might have to do some trimming to achieve the same thing, depending on how you opened the envelope.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652268055/" title="The Fold by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2470/3652268055_f272d12041.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="The Fold" /></a>\n\nAfter the square is cut, fold down the rim of the envelope all the way around, using the height of the square to determine how much is folded. If you want, you can cut a slit in the other corner of the envelope to help fold it down. I did this on the first stuff sack. For this one, I chose not to. There\'s a slight bit of bunching in that corner as a result, but it\'s fine.\n\nNow that you have the top flap folded down all along the top of the envelope, sew it shut. This creates a channel which we may then thread a bit of cord through, using it to cinch the sack shut.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3653065960/" title="The First Stitch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3373/3653065960_d768a18e18.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The First Stitch" /></a>\n\nI start my stitching on the inside of the envelope, poke the needle through, and pull all the thread through except for a tag of about 3". Then I poke the needle back through in another hole, pull all the thread through back to the inside, and use the tag end of the thread to tie a square knot, thus securing my first stitch.\n\nAfter that, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652270255/in/set-72157620193065231/">stitch your way around</a> till the channel is sewn shut and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652271297/in/set-72157620193065231/">tie off the end of the thread in whatever way you see fit</a>. I\'m a pretty poor sewer and am physically and mentally challenged when it comes to knots, which always makes for an interesting end to my stitches.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3653069638/" title="The Finished Stitching by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/3653069638_11235e18a2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The Finished Stitching" /></a>\n\nWith the sewing done, now would be a good time for the camera battery to die. Curse a little, perhaps shed a tear, then decide that your audience is intelligent enough to struggle through the next steps without pictures.\n\nFor this stuff sack, I used ALSE survival vest cord, also known as accessory cord or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord#Types">Type I paracord</a>. This stuff has a breaking strength of 100 lbs, is 1/16 of an inch in diameter, and tips the scale at 1oz per 50 feet. Pick it up at <a href="http://www.supplycaptain.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&product_ID=74&ParentCat=21">Supply Captain</a>. You could use any cord you happen to have, including the standard (Type III) 550 paracord, but I don\'t think the cord on this little stuff sack needs to have a breaking strength of 550lbs and Type III paracord is much, much heaver than Type I. We\'re trying to go lightweight here.\n\nIf you don\'t have any cordlocks lying around, these can also <a href="http://www.supplycaptain.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&product_ID=18">be got from the Captain</a>.\n\nThreading the cord through the channel can require a little perseverance. I usually tie a knot in one end, stick it in, and then use the knot to push the cord along with my fingers from the outside. If need be, you can shove a skinny stick or something in there to help it along.\n\nWhen the cord comes out the other side, all that\'s left is to cut it to length, slide the cordlock over both ends, tie some sort of knot so that the cordlock can\'t be inadvertently slide off the cord, and you\'re done!\n\nThe resulting stuff sack is durable, lightweight, and free (or close to it, depending on what materials you have in your craft box). Though you\'re obviously not going to get a water-tight seal by cinching the sack closed, the Tyvek material itself is waterproof and will suffice to keep your gear organized and dry in any pack. If water crossings and momentary submersion is a concern, use a trash bag as a liner in your pack and you will be very well off for almost no cost in weight or money.\n\nLighter, stronger, more waterproof, and better constructed stuff sacks can of course be purchased, but for an exponentially higher price. I have nice stuff sacks for my sleeping bag and spare clothes, so, for the time being, this Tyvek stuff sack is used for my food.\n\n<h2>March 2010 Update:</h2>\nCheck out the <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/gear/diy-tyvek-stuff-sacks/">new version of this tutorial on ITS Tactical</a>.'

Then I poke the needle back through in another hole, pull all the thread through back to the inside, and use the tag end of the thread to tie a square knot, thus securing my first stitch.</p>\n<p>After that, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652270255/in/set-72157620193065231/">stitch your way around</a> till the channel is sewn shut and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3652271297/in/set-72157620193065231/">tie off the end of the thread in whatever way you see fit</a>.

Curse a little, perhaps shed a tear, then decide that your audience is intelligent enough to struggle through the next steps without pictures.</p>\n<p>For this stuff sack, I used ALSE survival vest cord, also known as accessory cord or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord#Types">Type I paracord</a>. This stuff has a breaking strength of 100 lbs, is 1/16 of an inch in diameter, and tips the scale at 1oz per 50 feet. Pick it up at <a href="http://www.supplycaptain.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=74&amp;ParentCat=21">Supply Captain</a>. You could use any cord you happen to have, including the standard (Type III) 550 paracord, but I don&#8217;t think the cord on this little stuff sack needs to have a breaking strength of 550lbs and Type III paracord is much, much heaver than Type I. We&#8217;re trying to go lightweight here.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have any cordlocks lying around, these can also <a href="http://www.supplycaptain.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=18">be got from the Captain</a>.</p>\n<p>Threading the cord through the channel can require a little perseverance. I usually tie a knot in one end, stick it in, and then use the knot to push the cord along with my fingers from the outside. If need be, you can shove a skinny stick or something in there to help it along.</p>\n<p>When the cord comes out the other side, all that&#8217;s left is to cut it to length, slide the cordlock over both ends, tie some sort of knot so that the cordlock can&#8217;t be inadvertently slide off the cord, and you&#8217;re done!</p>\n<p>The resulting stuff sack is durable, lightweight, and free (or close to it, depending on what materials you have in your craft box). Though you&#8217;re obviously not going to get a water-tight seal by cinching the sack closed, the Tyvek material itself is waterproof and will suffice to keep your gear organized and dry in any pack. If water crossings and momentary submersion is a concern, use a trash bag as a liner in your pack and you will be very well off for almost no cost in weight or money.</p>\n<p>Lighter, stronger, more waterproof, and better constructed stuff sacks can of course be purchased, but for an exponentially higher price. I have nice stuff sacks for my sleeping bag and spare clothes, so, for the time being, this Tyvek stuff sack is used for my food.</p>\n<h2>March 2010 Update:</h2>\n\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/gear/diy-tyvek-stuff-sacks/">new version of this tutorial on ITS Tactical</a>.</p>'

In addition to having a digital display, it\'s also able to weigh in ounces, grams, pounds, and kilograms. It\'s accurate to 0.1 oz, which is good enough to me. The #35 in the product name signifies that it can weigh up to 35 lbs (they also have #55 and #75 models). The display bit can actually separate from the scale bit, which is a nifty feature when weighing over-sized items. The scale only cost $25 (including shipping). I bought it on eBay from <a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.com/www-OLDWILLKNOTT-com__W0QQ_armrsZ1">OldWillKnottScales</a>.\n\nI received the scale this morning.

    vellum_post_119.body = u'A lazy day of doing not much of anything sometimes makes me feel guilty. It requires that some evening activity take place -- something which gives one the satisfactory feeling of accomplishing something of use during the block of waking hours. Today I chose to spend the evening in the woods. I thought I might practice some knife skills, or just sit and read a book. Arriving at my spot I was unpleasantly greeted by a thick swarm of mosquitoes, greatly annoying me and foiling my plans for peace. I decided to start a small fire with a bit more green wood than usual. The smoke from a fire usually drives mosquitoes away and the green wood would put out more smoke than dead wood. When I was out collecting wood, I noticed a large patch of Stinging Nettles in the gully below where I was. The two thoughts of Nettles and fire brought to my mind an episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Food">Wild Food</a> where Ray Mears picked a few fresh Nettles and wilted them over the fire to neutralize their sting and improve the flavor. I eat a lot of Nettle raw, crushing the leaves to break the needles and get rid of the sting, but I thought I might try this new method.\n\nAfter the fire was going (and the mosquitoes buzzing off elsewhere), I put a small measure of dead wood on a corner of the fire to get a bit more flame than the smokey green wood was providing. This accomplished, I went back to the gully to collect a few stalks of nettle and return them to the fire. It took only about 15 seconds of holding one plant over the flame for it to become limp and drooping. I tested it a bit with my fingers to see if the sting had been neutralized. It had. Tearing off a bit and munching it around a bit in my mouth, I was greeted by quite a surprise: these wilted Nettles were, without doubt, the best Nettles I had ever tasted, perhaps even being the best wild weed I had ever enjoyed! I ate about a dozen tall plants, until I was quite satisfied with my evening snack. Occasionally I would leave a stalk hovering over the flame a bit longer than needed, but that would impart to the leaves a slightly toasted flavor, which I also found to be agreeable.\n\nI\'ll certainly be enjoying wilted Nettles again. It\'s a bit more trouble than just eating them raw, but, even on the move, it takes very little time to start a small fire and prepare a few picked plants in this way. The improved flavor greatly pays back the small investment in time.'

    vellum_post_120.body = u'My possibles pouch began as being simply a <a href="http://www.dougritter.com/psp_index.htm">Doug Ritter Pocket Survival Pak</a>. The Survival Pak comes in a waterproof envelope that is meant to be carried in a pocket. I prefer a belt-mounted solution, so I ditched the waterproof envelope and moved the contents to a <a href="http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Equipment/Pouches/SERE-Pouch">TAD Gear SERE SP pouch</a>. The SERE pouch has velcro webbing on the back, which allows it to be mounted to be mounted to any sort of belt or PALS webbing.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605587086/" title="Possibles Pouch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3605587086_f2412dbf2f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Possibles Pouch" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhen using the possibles pouch, I\'m often traveling with my Kifaru ZXR. The ZXR is built upon Kifaru\'s WrapTech Plus Suspension system, one of the primary components of which is the belt. The belt is a very thick, wide belt that is designed to work with the anatomy of the body and allow the user to comfortable carry obscenely heavy loads. The design of the ZXR\'s belt makes it unpractical to have many pouches mounted to your own pants belt. Because of this, I didn\'t want to actually mount the SERE pouch to my belt itself, but instead mount it so that it dropped down a bit below my waist, thus not interfering with the ZXR belt. To accomplish this, I simply tied a short loop of paracord through the pouch\'s webbing. To mount the pouch, I pull the loop through the backside of my belt and run the pouch through the loop. This allows me to both don and doff the pouch without removing my belt.\n\nThe contents of the pouch have changed since I first removed them from the waterproof envelope. The Doug Ritter Pocket Survival Pak still forms the base of the pouch, but I\'ve added and removed other items to cut down on redundancy and better compliment the other gear that I carry. I also don\'t intend the possibles pouch to be strictly a "survival" item. All of the pouch\'s contents have utility in a survival situation, but some of them are not intended explicitly for that.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3604782941/" title="Possibles Pouch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3304/3604782941_a2910d18db.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Possibles Pouch" /></a>\n\nThe contents are as follows:\n\n<ul>\n   <li>Ferrocerium rod, striker and paracord</li>\n   <li>Duct tape (26" x 2")</li>\n   <li>Pencil</li>\n   <li>Aluminum Foil (3 sq. ft.)</li>\n   <li>Condom</li>\n   <li>2 match strikers</li>\n   <li>8 Coghlan\'s Emergency Tinder</li>\n   <li>Sterile stainless steel surgical blade</li>\n   <li>20mm compass</li>\n   <li>Stainless steel utility wire (6\' of .020")</li>\n   <li>Signal mirror</li>\n   <li>Magnifying lens</li>\n   <li>4 large safety pins</li>\n   <li>Repair kit</li>\n   <li>Fishing kit</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe components that remain from the Doug Ritter Pocket Survival Pak are the duct tape, pencil, safety pins, 20mm compass, stainless steel utility wire, sterile stainless steel surgical blade, magnifying lens, signal mirror, and aluminum foil. The other items I\'ll cover here.\n\n<h2>Ferrocerium rod, striker and paracord</h2>\nThis is a standard <a href="http://lightmyfireusa.com/firesteel.html">Light My Fire Scout</a> firesteel and striker. It is not my primary firesteel, but a backup that I can be sure of always having securely attached. You might have noticed that the paracord that I use to secure the rod and striker to the pouch is rather long (about 3.5\'). Paracord, of course, has hundreds of uses, so carrying a bit more of it than is strictly necessary isn\'t always a bad idea. But the primary reason for the length of this particular piece of cord is that I can use it as a bow string on a fire-bow set.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605589564/" title="Possibles Pouch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3605589564_4dc69282fb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Possibles Pouch" /></a>\n\n<h2>Condom</h2>\nThis is just one standard latex condom. It can be used as a water carrier, a makeshift glove for a few fingers while taking care of a wound, a barrier to help stop the creation of a new species of half humans half wood nymphs, or utilized in the creation of emergency balloon animals.\n\n<h2>Match Strikers</h2>\n<a href="http://www.rei.com/product/617046">REI Storm Proof Matches</a> always come with 2 spare strikers sealed within a piece of plastic. I find that so-called "strike anywhere" matches can be hit and miss, so by carrying this, I assure myself of always having a dry, reliable surface to strike any kind of match on.\n\n<h2>Coghlan\'s Emergency Tinder</h2>\nThis stuff is not my favorite fire starting tinder, but it does work, and I have a bit of it kicking around, so I tossed it in. They\'re stored within a small waterproof bag.\n\n<h2 id="repair-kit">Repair Kit</h2>\nMy repair kit, I think, is somewhat ingenious. I like it, at least. I previously carried a small leather pouch with an assortment of different needles, types of thread, and safety pins. The whole thing was far larger and heavier than I could ever justify it being, so I ditched it and started from scratch. I got the idea for this new kit from the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com">BackpackingLight</a> Forums.\n\nThe container is an old <a href="http://www.pentel.com/catalog.php?title=Pencil%20Refills&cat_id=31">Pentel mechanical pencil led refill</a> case. This is the perfect size to secure the two needles I\'ve chosen to carry and the case itself is light enough to make me happy. (And it\'s free.)\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605576666/" title="Repair Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3605576666_b6f3d5c85e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Repair Kit" /></a>\n\nAround the outside of the case, I\'ve wrapped a length of black Kevlar thread. When I built this kit, I just wrapped till I got bored, so I have no idea how much thread there is. Enough, I think, for any repairs that I am likely to encounter. I chose Kevlar thread as the best complement of weight and strength. Previously, I carried a bit of standard, thin sewing thread. The thinness of that thread is suitable for sewing things like clothing, but it is decidedly weak. Kevlar thread is the same thickness, not noticeably heavier, but much stronger. I also previously carried a bit of thick waxed nylon string that is appropriate for sewing things like thick leather, heavy cotton canvas, or thick nylon. This is very heavy by my standards and overkill for most repair jobs. Out of all the gear I carry, it would probably be appropriate for repairing only my Kifaru rucksack. And Kifaru rucksacks don\'t fail. If by some strange happenstance it did fail, the Kevlar thread would probably be strong enough to get be back home or to some place where a more permanent repair could be made.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605578086/" title="Repair Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3605578086_e8d95cff06.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Repair Kit" /></a>\n\nInside the case I carry two needles. One that is thicker and stronger than most thin needles used for the hand-repair of clothing, but still small enough to qualify as small in my eye (just under 5mm in length and thin enough to not punch overly large holes in a thin cotton material). I believe this is the needle that comes with the Doug Ritter Survival Pak, but I could be wrong. The other needle is slightly longer (about 6mm) and has a slightly thicker head, making it more appropriate for heavier material. (I believe this one is technically a sail maker\'s needle, but I could be wrong. I have a variety of different needles I\'ve picked up over the years and lack the expertise to be able to identify their intended purpose.)\n\nAlso inside the case is a small safety pin. The purpose of this is actually just to take up more area inside the case so that the two needles don\'t bounce around and make noise.\n\nThis repair kit, along with the 4 large safety pins also carried in the possibles pouch, makes for a very small and lightweight repair kit that is able to tackle any of the problems that I may encounter. In addition to this, I also carry a half dozen safety pins of a varying sizes and a couple spare buttons within the rucksack itself. The guts of paracord and the floss in my toiletry kit can also be appropriated as thread.\n\n<h2 id="fishing-kit">Fishing Kit</h2>\nMy fishing kit is actually a combination fishing kit and glasses repair kit. An odd combination, you say? I agree.\n\nI am dependent on my glasses, so I have always carried a glasses repair kit. Such kits are available in any drug store in the country and usually consist of a small tube that contains a few of the small screws that most glasses use, a small screwdriver to match, and a couple spare rubber nose pieces.\n\nA year and a half ago I purchased a new pair of glasses that happen to have plastic nose pieces integrated into the frames. Recently, I was going through the possibles pouch, rethinking each item, and came upon the glasses repair kit. I opened it up and was shocked -- shocked, I tell you -- to discover that it contained two of those small rubber nose piece replacements. With my new glasses, these were completely useless to me. I had been carrying around an extra 2 grams (or so) all this time! I disposed of the offending pieces and felt better immediately.\n\nBut then I looked at the tube and its contents and decided that it really was a waste of space. The tube was far too large for the spare screws and screwdriver that it now contained. I shrugged, moved on to looking at the rest of the contents of the possibles pouch, and then had a stroke of brilliance. I would turn the glasses repair kit into a fishing kit!\n\nIt follows on the same principle as the repair kit.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605582766/" title="Fishing Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3605582766_a3a22c8f3f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fishing Kit" /></a>\n\nAround the outside of the tube, I wrapped a length of 4 lb monofilament fishing line ("ultragreen" in color).

The Survival Pak comes in a waterproof envelope that is meant to be carried in a pocket.

The SERE pouch has velcro webbing on the back, which allows it to be mounted to be mounted to any sort of belt or PALS webbing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605587086/" title="Possibles Pouch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3605587086_f2412dbf2f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Possibles Pouch" /></a>\n<!--more--></p>\n<p>When using the possibles pouch, I&#8217;m often traveling with my Kifaru ZXR. The ZXR is built upon Kifaru&#8217;s WrapTech Plus Suspension system, one of the primary components of which is the belt. The belt is a very thick, wide belt that is designed to work with the anatomy of the body and allow the user to comfortable carry obscenely heavy loads. The design of the ZXR&#8217;s belt makes it unpractical to have many pouches mounted to your own pants belt. Because of this, I didn&#8217;t want to actually mount the SERE pouch to my belt itself, but instead mount it so that it dropped down a bit below my waist, thus not interfering with the ZXR belt. To accomplish this, I simply tied a short loop of paracord through the pouch&#8217;s webbing. To mount the pouch, I pull the loop through the backside of my belt and run the pouch through the loop. This allows me to both don and doff the pouch without removing my belt.</p>\n<p>The contents of the pouch have changed since I first removed them from the waterproof envelope. The Doug Ritter Pocket Survival Pak still forms the base of the pouch, but I&#8217;ve added and removed other items to cut down on redundancy and better compliment the other gear that I carry. I also don&#8217;t intend the possibles pouch to be strictly a &#8220;survival&#8221; item. All of the pouch&#8217;s contents have utility in a survival situation, but some of them are not intended explicitly for that.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3604782941/" title="Possibles Pouch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3304/3604782941_a2910d18db.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Possibles Pouch" /></a></p>\n<p>The contents are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ferrocerium rod, striker and paracord</li>\n<li>Duct tape (26&#8221; x 2&#8221;)</li>\n<li>Pencil</li>\n<li>Aluminum Foil (3 sq. ft.)</li>\n<li>Condom</li>\n<li>2 match strikers</li>\n<li>8 Coghlan&#8217;s Emergency Tinder</li>\n<li>Sterile stainless steel surgical blade</li>\n<li>20mm compass</li>\n<li>Stainless steel utility wire (6&#8217; of .020&#8221;)</li>\n<li>Signal mirror</li>\n<li>Magnifying lens</li>\n<li>4 large safety pins</li>\n<li>Repair kit</li>\n<li>Fishing kit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The components that remain from the Doug Ritter Pocket Survival Pak are the duct tape, pencil, safety pins, 20mm compass, stainless steel utility wire, sterile stainless steel surgical blade, magnifying lens, signal mirror, and aluminum foil. The other items I&#8217;ll cover here.</p>\n<h2>Ferrocerium rod, striker and paracord</h2>\n\n<p>This is a standard <a href="http://lightmyfireusa.com/firesteel.html">Light My Fire Scout</a> firesteel and striker. It is not my primary firesteel, but a backup that I can be sure of always having securely attached. You might have noticed that the paracord that I use to secure the rod and striker to the pouch is rather long (about 3.5&#8217;). Paracord, of course, has hundreds of uses, so carrying a bit more of it than is strictly necessary isn&#8217;t always a bad idea. But the primary reason for the length of this particular piece of cord is that I can use it as a bow string on a fire-bow set.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605589564/" title="Possibles Pouch by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3605589564_4dc69282fb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Possibles Pouch" /></a>\n<h2>Condom</h2>\nThis is just one standard latex condom. It can be used as a water carrier, a makeshift glove for a few fingers while taking care of a wound, a barrier to help stop the creation of a new species of half humans half wood nymphs, or utilized in the creation of emergency balloon animals.</p>\n<h2>Match Strikers</h2>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.rei.com/product/617046">REI Storm Proof Matches</a> always come with 2 spare strikers sealed within a piece of plastic. I find that so-called &#8220;strike anywhere&#8221; matches can be hit and miss, so by carrying this, I assure myself of always having a dry, reliable surface to strike any kind of match on.</p>\n<h2>Coghlan&#8217;s Emergency Tinder</h2>\n\n<p>This stuff is not my favorite fire starting tinder, but it does work, and I have a bit of it kicking around, so I tossed it in. They&#8217;re stored within a small waterproof bag.</p>\n<h2 id="repair-kit">Repair Kit</h2>\n\n<p>My repair kit, I think, is somewhat ingenious. I like it, at least. I previously carried a small leather pouch with an assortment of different needles, types of thread, and safety pins. The whole thing was far larger and heavier than I could ever justify it being, so I ditched it and started from scratch. I got the idea for this new kit from the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com">BackpackingLight</a> Forums.</p>\n<p>The container is an old <a href="http://www.pentel.com/catalog.php?title=Pencil%20Refills&amp;cat_id=31">Pentel mechanical pencil led refill</a> case. This is the perfect size to secure the two needles I&#8217;ve chosen to carry and the case itself is light enough to make me happy. (And it&#8217;s free.)</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605576666/" title="Repair Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3605576666_b6f3d5c85e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Repair Kit" /></a></p>\n<p>Around the outside of the case, I&#8217;ve wrapped a length of black Kevlar thread. When I built this kit, I just wrapped till I got bored, so I have no idea how much thread there is. Enough, I think, for any repairs that I am likely to encounter. I chose Kevlar thread as the best complement of weight and strength. Previously, I carried a bit of standard, thin sewing thread. The thinness of that thread is suitable for sewing things like clothing, but it is decidedly weak. Kevlar thread is the same thickness, not noticeably heavier, but much stronger. I also previously carried a bit of thick waxed nylon string that is appropriate for sewing things like thick leather, heavy cotton canvas, or thick nylon. This is very heavy by my standards and overkill for most repair jobs. Out of all the gear I carry, it would probably be appropriate for repairing only my Kifaru rucksack. And Kifaru rucksacks don&#8217;t fail. If by some strange happenstance it did fail, the Kevlar thread would probably be strong enough to get be back home or to some place where a more permanent repair could be made.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605578086/" title="Repair Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3605578086_e8d95cff06.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Repair Kit" /></a></p>\n<p>Inside the case I carry two needles. One that is thicker and stronger than most thin needles used for the hand-repair of clothing, but still small enough to qualify as small in my eye (just under 5mm in length and thin enough to not punch overly large holes in a thin cotton material). I believe this is the needle that comes with the Doug Ritter Survival Pak, but I could be wrong. The other needle is slightly longer (about 6mm) and has a slightly thicker head, making it more appropriate for heavier material. (I believe this one is technically a sail maker&#8217;s needle, but I could be wrong. I have a variety of different needles I&#8217;ve picked up over the years and lack the expertise to be able to identify their intended purpose.)</p>\n<p>Also inside the case is a small safety pin. The purpose of this is actually just to take up more area inside the case so that the two needles don&#8217;t bounce around and make noise.</p>\n<p>This repair kit, along with the 4 large safety pins also carried in the possibles pouch, makes for a very small and lightweight repair kit that is able to tackle any of the problems that I may encounter. In addition to this, I also carry a half dozen safety pins of a varying sizes and a couple spare buttons within the rucksack itself. The guts of paracord and the floss in my toiletry kit can also be appropriated as thread.</p>\n<h2 id="fishing-kit">Fishing Kit</h2>\n\n<p>My fishing kit is actually a combination fishing kit and glasses repair kit. An odd combination, you say? I agree.</p>\n<p>I am dependent on my glasses, so I have always carried a glasses repair kit. Such kits are available in any drug store in the country and usually consist of a small tube that contains a few of the small screws that most glasses use, a small screwdriver to match, and a couple spare rubber nose pieces.</p>\n<p>A year and a half ago I purchased a new pair of glasses that happen to have plastic nose pieces integrated into the frames. Recently, I was going through the possibles pouch, rethinking each item, and came upon the glasses repair kit. I opened it up and was shocked &#8212; shocked, I tell you &#8212; to discover that it contained two of those small rubber nose piece replacements. With my new glasses, these were completely useless to me. I had been carrying around an extra 2 grams (or so) all this time! I disposed of the offending pieces and felt better immediately.</p>\n<p>But then I looked at the tube and its contents and decided that it really was a waste of space. The tube was far too large for the spare screws and screwdriver that it now contained. I shrugged, moved on to looking at the rest of the contents of the possibles pouch, and then had a stroke of brilliance. I would turn the glasses repair kit into a fishing kit!</p>\n<p>It follows on the same principle as the repair kit.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3605582766/" title="Fishing Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3605582766_a3a22c8f3f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fishing Kit" /></a></p>\n<p>Around the outside of the tube, I wrapped a length of 4 lb monofilament fishing line (&#8220;ultragreen&#8221; in color). Again, I did not measure the length, but it is plenty for such an emergency kit.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3604768153/" title="Fishing Kit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/3604768153_fd364f9234.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fishing Kit" /></a></p>\n<p>Inside the tube, I placed 4 small hooks, 2 split shot, and 2 snap swivels.

It is a type of rust, but a good one, that protects the blade rather than corroding and eating away at the metal. Over time, most knives will develop a patina, regardless of the material that they\'re made from. Many people are attracted to the <a href="http://mlknives.com/blog/2009/02/03/patina-a-beautiful-thing/">distinctive and aged look</a> that a patina imparts onto a knife, and will make an effort to force a patina onto their blades. The easiest way to do so is to use the knife to prepare acidic foods: potatoes, onions, tomatoes, pickles, and the like all work well. Some people will soak a rag in vinegar and wrap it around the blade, or coat the blade with mustard and leave it overnight.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI wanted to force a patina onto my BCNW-O1, for both the aged look and the extra protection that it gives. The first step I took was to take a slightly-moldy potato out of my fridge and stab the blade into it, up to the handle. I left this in overnight. In the morning, I took the blade out, rinsed it, and stabbed it into another spot on the potato. I repeated this through-out the day, leaving the blade in one spot for a few hours at a time. This sort of approach adds a multi-layered texture to the patina.\n\nAfter the blade had been in and out of the potato for about 24 hours, I tossed the potato, cleaned the knife, and used it to slice an orange. After the orange was sliced, I left the knife on the plate with the orange as I ate, so that the juices could soak into the blade a bit. After this, I rinsed and dried the blade again, then sliced another orange the next day.\n\nI figured all of this would probably be good enough, so, after slicing the final orange, I rinsed the blade once more, then gave it a good scrubbing with a soapy sponge to clean off any bacteria that might be growing on it after all the exposure to food. This removed a lot of the rust -- more than I thought it would -- but, after I dried the knife off, I had a beautiful patina on the blade.\n\nSince the patina is a type of rust, it does eat away the sharp edge of the knife a bit. So, after it was all clean, I gave the knife a session on my 6000 grit japanese water stone, which sharpened it back up again.\n\nUsually after the sharpening the knife, I coat it in camellia oil, which was used in Japan by samurais to protect their blades. It is a non-toxic oil that is often used for skin care, and can even be cooked with, so I have no problem using it on a knife that I will prepare food with and eat with. The main purpose of the oil is to protect the blade from rust so, with the patina applied, it is not strictly as necessary as before. Still, I apply it so that both it and the patina can ward away any bad rust.\n\nUsing a fine-grit Japanese water stone with a nagura stone to sharpen the blade creates a slightly abrasive cleaner that can be purposefully rubbed into the blade to clean off the beginnings of a patina, if one so desires. I do not do this on purpose, but I have sharpened my knife multiple times since applying the patina and, as a result, the bevel of the blade is much shinier and less-rusted than the upper part.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3422982570/" title="Patina on the Spine by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3422982570_1d353b8275.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Patina on the Spine" /></a>\n\nYou can tell this patina is forced, because it terminates at the handle (I couldn\'t stab it into the potato any deeper!) of the BCNW-O1. The exposed part of the tang is shiny clean, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3033849536/in/set-72157609164378887/">new</a>.'

Some of my townsmen, it is true, can remember, and have described to me some walks which they took ten years ago, in which they were so blessed as to lose themselves for half an hour in the woods, but I know very well that they have confined themselves to the highway ever since, whatever pretensions they may make to belong to this select class. No doubt, they were elevated for a moment as by the reminiscence of a previous state of existence, when even they were foresters and outlaws.</p>\n<p>Henry David Thoreau</blockquote></p>'

    vellum_post_127.body = u'I have refrained from posting gear lists from my travels here mostly out of laziness, but partly because of a fear that they will be taken as absolute. The gear that I pack varies greatly from trip to trip. The type of travel, duration, terrain, and anticipated weather all factor into what I pack. On top of this, I always experiment with different gear and different configurations, seeking the best of both. Thus, my gear will differ even on nearly identical trips.\n\nI should also note that I pack with an eye towards preparedness. That is to say that, for me, the only difference between 3 days and 30 days is the amount of food, and I\'m not going to be carrying 30 days worth of food, anyway.\n\nStill, people have expressed interest in what I pack, and I know that I do appreciate it when others whom I respect post their pack lists. So, here is the list from my last trip. The trip was 7 days long, and included about 85 miles of travel on dirt trails, paved roads, and bushwhacking. The route was never what I would call true wilderness or backcountry, meaning that I was always within one days walk of an urban area -- and by urban I mean what is probably rural by most standards. The route also took me directly through small towns, which allowed me to restock on food.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI performed the trip over the last week of March. Days got up to around 45 degrees Fahrenheit, with nights around 35. Days were unusually dry (which meant it misted constantly, but didn\'t actually rain). During the night, it did rain, but not terribly hard. On the first night, which was at about 1700 feet, it snowed. (The rest of the hike was through valleys and along the coast, so the elevation was well below 1000 feet.) In all, this pack list is a good representation of what I will choose to carry in Winter, not Spring. In the deep, dark of Winter, I will probably carry a few more layers of clothing and switch out some of the lighter garments for heavier ones, but, other than that, this list represents a more-or-less standard pack list for a one week journey in a Cascadian Winter, below elevation.\n\nI do not have a reliable scale, so I cannot weigh my gear. All in all, I\'d estimate the pack to be at about 45 lbs.\n\nI\'m compiling this list a few days after returning from the trip. I have already unpacked about half the items, so I may have missed something, but the bulk of the gear is certainly here. If you have any questions, or notice any stark absences, feel free to comment. Ideally, I would create a pack list as I\'m packing, before the trip. Maybe next time...\n\nThe list is subdivided into two sections: what I wore on my body and what I carried in my pack. In the pack section, I decided to separate out what was carried in the lid (called an XTL), which detaches to become a man-purse and so also functions as a sort of escape and evasion bag (or a bail-out bag for the bail-out bag) and the body of the ZXR itself. Otherwise, I have not distinguished between what is carried in the main compartment, the slot pockets, or mounted on the belt. The clothing consists of three main insulating layers: a light wool shirt, a fleece vest, and a lightweight fleece jacket. These three would, of course, alternate between my body and my pack depending on where I was and what I was doing. During most of the hiking, I wore the wool shirt and packed the other two.\n\n<h2>Worn On Body</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Smartwool Hiking socks</li>\n\t<li>Smartwool Microweight Boxer Briefs</li>\n\t<li>Ibex Woolies long underwear bottoms</li>\n\t<li>Patagonia Capilene Level 2 long sleeve tshirt</li>\n\t<li>Nemesis Hellion neck knife</li>\n\t<li>Atwood Tactical Whistle (worn on paracord around neck)</li>\n\t<li>Railriders Versatac Light pants\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Small bandana</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Ultimate Survival Technologies Strike Force</li>\n\t\t\t<li>K & M Industries Matchcase</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Hair tie</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Bic lighter</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The Wilderness Tactical Frequent Flyer belt\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Bushcraft Northwest BCNW-O1 knife</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Leatherman Charge ALX</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Pendleton Western lightweight wool shirt</li>\n\t<li>Buff</li>\n\t<li>Filson Tin Cloth Packer Hat</li>\n\t<li>Lowa Renegade Gore-Tex boots\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Sole Ed Viesturs Ultra Cushion footbeds</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n</li></ul>\n\t\n<h2>Kifaru ZXR</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Kifaru XTL\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Kifaru Standard Chamber Pocket\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Rite-in-the-Rain notepad (model 393-M)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Lens cloth</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Hair tie</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Glasses strap</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Badger Healing Balm</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Purell Hand Sanitizer</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Jetstream ballpoint pen</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Fisher space pen</li>\n\t\t\t<li>REI titanium spork</li>\n\t\t\t<li>2x spare camera batteries</li>\n\t\t\t<li>REI keychain thermometer</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Large ziploc\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Maps (5x)</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Inova 24/7 with head band</li>\n\t\t<li>Light My Fire Scout Swedish Firesteel and striker</li>\n\t\t<li>Cell phone</li>\n\t\t<li>Possibles pouch <em>(Note: I\'m not going to discuss the contents of this here, as I\'m rethinking it with an eye toward redesign.

    vellum_post_128.body = u'Despite investing a lot of money into my footwear, thrashing them heavily, and depending on them to carry me further, I\'ve never spent any effort on cleaning or caring for my boots. A month or so ago, I was in REI and took a gander at the footwear section. They happened to have a pair of <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/02/02/lowa-renegade-mid-hiking-boots/">Lowa Renegades</a> on the rack. The Renegades remain my primary boots that I wear on a daily basis and for the vast majority of my travel. I was shocked by the contrast of the boots on my feet and those on the rack. The boots are made of nubuk leather with some cordura around the ankle band. New, the leather is of a smooth, dark blue color. The leather on my feet was dry, wrinkly, and of a brownish-green color. This made me think that maybe there was something to that whole boot care thing, after all.\n\nI didn\'t know much about leather care, nor what I should look for in a product. My first stop for research like this is the Kifaru Forums. The forums are peopled predominantly by those whom I think of as the modern day longhunters and mountain men. I take their gear advice very seriously in considering all of my purchases. The overwhelming opinion on the forums was for a product called <a href="http://www.obenaufs.com">Obenauf\'s</a>. Obenauf\'s makes three relevant products: <a href="https://www.obenaufs.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=25">White Jaguar Leather Cleaner</a>, <a href="https://www.obenaufs.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=18">Leather Oil</a>, and <a href="https://www.obenaufs.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=20">Heavy Duty Leather Preservative (LP)</a>. The LP, in particular, was developed for and by wildland fire firefighters. What with the hiking, the heat, and the smoke, I can\'t think of any other profession that demands more out of leather boots. I promptly placed an order for $50 worth of product.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nAfter a week-long trek, my boots were soaked through and caked with mud. I was looking forward to trying out my new Obenauf\'s products. The first thing I did was remove the <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/05/sole-and-superfeet/">Sole insoles</a> (which I clean separately) and attack the boots with a hose, blasting the mud off the outsides and flooding the inside. After about half a day on a boot dryer, the boots were dry, both inside and out, and had returned to the familiar dry, wrinkly, brownish-green color.\n\n<h2>White Jaguar Leather Cleaner</h2>\n\nThe first product I used was the White Jaguar Leather Cleaner. They claim the cleaner is a water based solution of natural plant ingredients. As such, it is non-toxic and biodegradable. Obenauf\'s recommendation is to spray some of the cleaner onto an applicator, such as cloth, sponge, or soft-bristles brush. Then work it into the boot with a soft, circular motion, which lifts the dirt, and finally wipe the dirt off with a clean cloth. They warn against soaking the applicator. I found that this did not work very good at all on the nubuk leather. Instead, I sprayed the cleaner directly onto the boots, soaking them thoroughly but stopping just before the point where the cleaner would begin to run. Having soaked the boots, I worked the leather with a nail brush, making circular motions to lift the dirt off. I then wiped off the dirt with a clean cloth. This worked much better than the recommended method. I repeated the process 4 times on each boot, till the dirt stopped coming off.\n\nI\'m not sure if the White Jaguar cleaner is in any way superior to, say, a sudsy bath of <a href="http://www.drbronner.com/">Dr. Bronner\'s</a>, which is the soap I use on everything else. This would clean the cordura as well, and I can\'t imagine it would do much harm to the leather. I will probably try this method next time for comparison.\n\n<h2>Leather Oil</h2>\n\nRegardless of which cleaner is used, the leather will now be very dry and free of all oils, which must be addressed. Obenauf\'s says of leather that "it\'s a skin, with fibers and pores that requires proper natural lubrication and needs to breathe. Because it no longer has a body to provide proper natural oils, we must." They claim that other products "soften by weakening or decomposing the fibers and they waterproof by sealing the pores." Their own product, by contrast, is a combination of natural oils that maintains and preserves the leather\'s natural properties.\n\nThey recommend applying the oil at a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. The ambient temperature when I was doing this was around 45 degrees. I decided to hit the boots with a hair-dryer to warm up the leather a bit before the application. Then I applied the oil to the boots, lobbing it on in obscene amounts. One coating per boot, then I went over both of them with the hair-dryer again to encourage the oil to soak in. Obenauf\'s recommends two coatings approximately one hour apart. Because my boots took so long to dry after the encounter with the hose, it was rather late after the first oiling, so I left the boots to soak overnight and went to bed. In the morning, I did a second application the same as before, treating the leather to the hair-dryer both before and after. After this, I let the boots set another hour, then lightly wiped off any excess with a cloth.\n\nIf you\'re a masochist and appreciate ugly, attention-grabbing footwear, you could also use this oil to buff the leather to a shine.\n\nThe transformation of the leather was amazing. Save for a few scuff marks here and there, the boots look identical to the brand new pair that caught my eye on the store shelf. They\'ve returned to the dark, rich blue color and no longer look so dry and chapped.\n\n<h2>Heavy Duty Leather Preservative</h2>\n\nThe third step, for long term preservation, was the application of the leather preservative. The LP is made of three different natural oils that are suspended in beeswax and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propolis">propolis</a>. This wax allows the oils to gradually seep into and lubricate the oil over time. Being exposed to flexing or extreme heat, rather than drying the leather out, encourages the wax to release the oils faster, thus preserving the leather.\n\nTo apply the LP, I once again heated the leather with the hair-dryer. Then, I turned the hair dryer onto the LP itself. Holding it over the jar for about a minute melted the wax a bit, making it easier the apply. Obenauf\'s recommends applying the LP by hand, as your natural body heat will also help to warm the wax and encourage the leather to accept it. So, I dipped in a couple fingers and started spreading the wax all over the leather. After coating the first boot, I went over it with the hair-dryer again to help it penetrate a bit more. Obenauf\'s recommends two coatings of the LP, which is what I did. The LP darkened the color of the leather more so than the oil, and also gave them a slightly waxy gloss. The boots actually look a bit too new and fancy for my taste now. I\'ll have to rough them up a bit on the next hike.\n\nI\'m very happy with all three of the products from Obenauf\'s, particularly the oil and the LP, which seemed to have worked magic on my boots. I\'d recommend them to anybody who demands heavily on their boots. I plan to work them into a regular care schedule for my own boots, extending the life of my investments.\n\nIf anybody with more experience has suggestions for other products or a critique of my method, let me know.'

But by pushing my body and mind further than where I actually require it to go, the pleasure, serenity, and ease of travel is heightened.\n\nI find that no amount of running, biking, or light-weight day hiking adequately prepares the body for the weight of the ruck and life on The Road. So, this year, I\'m continuing the training. Yesterday was day one. I hadn\'t walked under my heavy rucksack for a couple of months, so I started out with something probably closer to 50 lbs and did a 15 mile trip that lacked much elevation change.\n\nIt felt good to dust off the rucksack and move around some. At the end of the day, I could feel the strain in my gluteal muscles. Today I\'m only a little bit sore. The exercise works and I\'m glad of my starting weight and mileage.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\'ll increase the weight and mileage until I reach stability. At that point, I\'ll keep things interesting by using my GPS to clock my speed and see what I can do about cutting down on time.\n\n<blockquote>I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least -- and it is commonly more than that -- sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. You may safely say, A penny for your thoughts, or a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them -- as if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon -- I think that they deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago.\n\nHenry David Thoreau\n</blockquote>'

    vellum_post_133.body = u'Last Saturday, I took a train into Seattle to meet up with some of the members of RantMedia\'s Washington cell. In attendance were OneeyedElf1, SideSlide, HatterOfMaddnesz, Avagdu, myself, and another who I will dub PlantGirl.\n\nOneeyedElf1 was the first to arrive at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246382030/in/set-72157613252092394/">Bauhaus Books &amp; Coffee</a>. I got in a bit past noon, after walking the few blocks from the train station. Neither of us had seen or met SideSlide yet, but, soon thereafter, a fellow walked in with a Maxpedition Versipack and we figured that must be him. OneeyedElf1 and I were both sporting our Rant 10th Anniversary shirts, which attracted SideSlide to our place at the bar. He introduced us to PlantGirl, who was not familiar with RantMedia but had consented to joining us on our exploits, and we moved to a table upstairs.\n\nWe talked about the various things that people like us talk about and SideSlide <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245550707/in/set-72157613252092394/">prepared for the day\'s main activity</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching">geocaching</a>. SideSlide was the most experienced geocacher in our group -- and the most prepared -- so he took the lead.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246379738/" title="SideSlide\'s Gear by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3132/3246379738_18c77182b5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="SideSlide\'s Gear" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nAfter a while of sitting around, OneeyedElf1 managed to contact Avagdu, who informed us that he would be late (some nonsense about not realizing about what day it was). None of us had contact information for HatterOfMaddnesz, but we thought that there was a good chance that he would be carpooling with Avagdu, so we decided to start the adventures without them. SideSlide selected <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246379136/in/set-72157613252092394/">the first target</a>.\n\nOutside the coffee shop, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245553693/in/set-72157613252092394/">SideSlide, PlantGirl, and myself waited for OneeyedElf1 to move his car</a> before we all took off.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245555799/" title="OneeyedElf1, SlideSide, and PlantGirl by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/3245555799_e9060d7ac7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="OneeyedElf1, SlideSide, and PlantGirl" /></a>\n\nWe knew this first cache was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246384264/in/set-72157613252092394/">near REI</a>, so we headed in that direction. As we got close, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245557759/in/set-72157613252092394"/>SideSlide consulted his GPS.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245558625/" title="8ft to Target by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/3245558625_ec524559c7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="8ft to Target" /></a>\n\nThe GPS indicated that the cache was probably somewhere in the bushes, so we all dived in. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246387140/in/set-72157613252092394/">PlantGirl was the one who found it</a>. This first cache was a micro, which is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245560917/in/set-72157613252092394/">very small</a>.

They didn\'t have what I was looking for, so I left empty-handed. SideSlide <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245562185/in/set-72157613252092394/">bought an MSR Dromlite bag</a> and PlantGirl picked up one of those CamelBak water bottles.\n\nWhile inside REI, OneeyedElf1 and I discovered that we both have <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2007/04/06/atwood-tactical-whistle/">Atwood Tactical Whistles</a> on our keychains (though his is titanium, while I have one of the older stainless steel models).\n\nAt the checkout stand, we had another obligatory wog moment when I noticed what SideSlide was paying out of. "Hey, is that a Spec-Ops wallet," I asked, while brandishing my own for him to see. (If this doesn\'t happen, you\'re not at a RantMeet.)\n\nBack outside, we <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245562795/in/set-72157613252092394/">located the next target</a> and set off.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245564167/" title="PlantGirl, SideSlide, and OneeyedElf1 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3125/3245564167_c9df24369c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="PlantGirl, SideSlide, and OneeyedElf1" /></a>\n\nThis cache was in the neighboring <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245565169/in/set-72157613252092394/">community garden</a> and was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245566275/in/set-72157613252092394/">located by SideSlide</a>.\n\nBefore heading to the next cache, SideSlide used the public restroom. When he returned, he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246394652/in/set-72157613252092394/">digged into his bag</a>, revealing that all important piece of kit: baby wipes.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246395248/" title="SideSlide\'s Babywipes by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/3246395248_71a6987b56.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="SideSlide\'s Babywipes" /></a>\n\nAfter this, we heading back across i-5 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246395954/in/set-72157613252092394/">in search of the third cache</a>. It was more difficult to find, as it was a nano cache, which is very, very small.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246396718/" title="Target 3 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3427/3246396718_245994f1af.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Target 3" /></a>\n\nRolled up inside was a piece of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246397472/in/set-72157613252092394/">appropriately small paper</a>.

We continued to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245578037/in/set-72157613252092394/">search unsuccessfully</a> until OneeyedElf1 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245578823/in/set-72157613252092394/">pulled out his phone</a> and found a picture of where the cache was hidden.\n\nFinally, we found the cache (in a place that we had previously looked). It was in an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246407568/in/set-72157613252092394/">old ziploc bag</a> which we <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245580533/in/set-72157613252092394/">replaced with a new one</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246408938/in/set-72157613252092394/">returned to its hiding spot</a>.\n\nDuring all of this, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245575905/in/set-72157613252092394/">Avagdu had called OneeyedElf1</a> to inform him that he was in town. We didn\'t know how to direct him to where we were, so we decided to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246409376/in/set-72157613252092394/">walk back to Bauhaus</a> and meet him there. When we arrived, we found both Avagdu and HatterOfMaddnesz sipping coffee.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245583015/" title="HatterOfMaddnesz and Avagdu by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/3245583015_d003739de8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="HatterOfMaddnesz and Avagdu" /></a>\n\nWe <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245582185/in/set-72157613252092394/">talked a bit</a> and in a few minutes, the table was cluttered with multiple GPS systems, compasses, knifes, and lighters.\n\nAfter HatterOfMaddnesz finished his drink, we decided to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245583647/in/set-72157613252092394/">go in search of food</a>. Our first attempt proved futile, as the place was not serving food for another hour, so <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246412040/in/set-72157613252092394/">we ventured on</a> in search of another restaurant.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246412658/" title="PlantGirl, OneeyedElf1, SideSlide, and Avagdu by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/3246412658_7fdd3b6c7d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="PlantGirl, OneeyedElf1, SideSlide, and Avagdu" /></a>\n\nEventually we found a bar that served pizza, which was good enough for our tastes. We ordered two larges and spent about an hour discussing various subjects and sharing more gear. Most of the excitement occurred on Avagdu\'s part. He passed his fire making kit to SideSlide for inspection, which SideSlide promptly dropped directly into his beer. Luckily, Avagdu\'s kit was waterproof. A while later, Avagdu reached for a slice of pizza. When he lifted the piece, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245585739/in/set-72157613252092394/">all the toppings fell off onto the plate</a>. This was dubbed Pizza <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=epic+fail">Fail</a>.\n\nAs we left the bar, Avagdu borrowed PlantGirl\'s purse for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246414034/in/set-72157613252092394/">glamour shot</a> and to demonstrate the latest fashion in tactical EDC bags.\n\nAfter a quick trip into a drugstore in search of batteries for the GPS, we started to walk down the hill, in the direction of Avagdu\'s car and the next cache.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246414734/" title="Plantgirl and Avagdu by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/3246414734_493cd908a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Plantgirl and Avagdu" /></a>\n\nAvagdu had to plug the meter at his parking spot. When we reached his car, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245588091/in/set-72157613252092394/">we spotted a flyer on the windshield</a> that appeared to be a ticket, but, upon closer inspection, proved to be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3246415316/in/set-72157613252092394/">an advertisement</a>.\n\nAfter plugging the meter, we went off in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245588741/in/set-72157613252092394/">search of the next cache</a>. This one proved to be the most difficult to find, but it was eventually found by PlantGirl. After finally locating it, the sun was almost set and we began to head downtown in an attempt to locate the final cache. We did not have coordinates for this final cache, but instead had been provided with a series of puzzles to crack. I had to start the trek back to the train station before we could solve all the puzzles and locate the cache, so I don\'t know if that search was successful.\n\nAll my photos from the meet are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157613252092394/">on flickr</a>.

    vellum_post_133.body_rendered = u'<p>Last Saturday, I took a train into Seattle to meet up with some of the members of RantMedia&#8217;s Washington cell.

I got in a bit past noon, after walking the few blocks from the train station. Neither of us had seen or met SideSlide yet, but, soon thereafter, a fellow walked in with a Maxpedition Versipack and we figured that must be him. OneeyedElf1 and I were both sporting our Rant 10th Anniversary shirts, which attracted SideSlide to our place at the bar. He introduced us to PlantGirl, who was not familiar with RantMedia but had consented to joining us on our exploits, and we moved to a table upstairs.</p>\n<p>We talked about the various things that people like us talk about and SideSlide <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3245550707/in/set-72157613252092394/">prepared for the day&#8217;s main activity</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching">geocaching</a>.

None of us had contact information for HatterOfMaddnesz, but we thought that there was a good chance that he would be carpooling with Avagdu, so we decided to start the adventures without them.

    vellum_post_134.body = u'I\'ve had a few requests to do a review of the new stove system I\'ve been using for the past couple weeks. I don\'t feel like I have enough experience with it yet to do a proper review, but I snapped some photos today to let people know what it\'s all about.\n\nThe system is a <a href="http://traildesigns.com/caldera-tt.html">Trail Designs Caldera Ti-Tri Titanium Stove System</a>. It takes the older (and very popular) <a href="http://traildesigns.com/caldera-cone.html">Caldera Cone</a> and combines some of the know-how of the folks at <a href="http://www.titaniumgoat.com/">Titanium Goat</a> to create a light-weight system that burns alcohol, Esbit tabs, and wood. And, of course, it\'s made of titanium.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208481270/" title="Ti-Tri Burning Alcohol by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3387/3208481270_e3501d3c82.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ti-Tri Burning Alcohol" /></a>\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIf you already have a pot you\'d like to use, you can contact Trail Designs and have them build a cone for you. Elsewise, the Ti-Tri is <a href="http://www.titaniumgoat.com/TiTri.html">available with a pot from Titanium Goat</a>. I\'ve <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/12/21/titanium/">previously mentioned</a> my love affair with my Snow Peak Trek 700 mug/cup/pot/thing, but I had been thinking of acquiring a larger, 900ml pot for somewhat more extravagant cooking. Because of this, I decided to get the 900ml Ti-Tri from Titanium Goat, rather than have a Ti-Tri built for my Snow Peak mug.\n\nTitanium Goat\'s 900ml pot is a basic affair: handles on the body, a decent lid with a thingy on top that allows it to be easily lifted, as well as three holes for venting or draining water. Titanium Goat claims that the pot and mug weigh in at 4.4oz, which seems correct to me.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208379032/" title="Titanium Goat 900ml Pot by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3208379032_673c635eb3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Titanium Goat 900ml Pot" /></a>\n\nThe Ti-Tri system itself comes inside of the same <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207526647/in/set-72157612681073007/">caddy system</a> as does the normal Caldera. It\'s basically <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208433002/in/set-72157612681073007/">two pieces of plastic that screw together</a>. The diameter of the caddy is the same as a 32oz Nalgene, so it will nest in the same cups (such as the aforementioned Snow Peak 700). This is a somewhat bulky way of carrying the system, I find, but the caddy is constructed out of food grade plastic, so both pieces can double as a bowl or mug. It also does a great job of protecting all the components. So far, I\'ve been packing everything in the caddy. I haven\'t decided if I\'ll keep doing it that way or not.\n\nThe alcohol stove that comes with the Ti-Tri is a Trail Designs 12-10 which, they claim, has been designed to "perform optimally with the restricted air flow and higher heat retained by the cone during operation." My expertise in the design of alcohol stoves are lacking and, as I said before, I don\'t feel I yet have enough experience with this system to draw a comparison between it and <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/12/21/titanium/">my Vargo Triad XE</a> (which I also haven\'t had for all that long), but the 12-10 has seemed extremely efficient so far (and much easier to light).\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208387846/" title="Trail Designs 12-10 Stove by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3369/3208387846_876369a5fc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Trail Designs 12-10 Stove" /></a>\n\nThe Ti-Tri cone itself is made from a piece of very thin titanium foil. On either side of the cone is a rib -- <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208399808/in/set-72157612681073007/">the smaller slides into the larger, and there\'s your cone</a>. It\'s very easy to assemble. The cone has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207556633/in/set-72157612681073007/">air vents on the top</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208403586/in/set-72157612681073007/">the bottom</a>. When assembled, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208407038/in/set-72157612681073007/">the cone goes over the stove</a>, and the pot nests into the top.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207562473/" title="Ti-Tri Cone, Stove, and Pot by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3439/3207562473_1a23ee1d42.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ti-Tri Cone, Stove, and Pot" /></a>\n\nThe pot\'s lip holds it up. Even with the thinness of the cone\'s material, it is a surprisingly sturdy setup. You do have to be somewhat watchful when sliding the pot into the cone, as the pot handle\'s mountings will sometimes get caught on the edge of the cone\'s opening. I say sometimes, but this actually happens to me the majority of the time. It\'s greatly annoying.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208408906/" title="Ti-Tri Cone and Pot: Stuck by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3323/3208408906_b7efa7abb5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ti-Tri Cone and Pot: Stuck" /></a>\n\nIf you\'re sure to center the handles over the opening in the side of the cone, the handle mountings will not get caught.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207565921/in/set-72157612681073007/">The base</a> is an optional addition to the Ti-Tri system to be used for wood burning. It\'s simply another piece of titanium foil, slightly larger in diameter than the cone. When burning wood, you <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208417058/in/set-72157612681073007/">set the cone on the base</a>, put the included titanium stakes <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208420654/in/set-72157612681073007/">through the holes in one end of the cone</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208422862/in/set-72157612681073007/">out the other</a>. These then support the pot higher up, allowing you to shove your fuel in the cone\'s side opening.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207579947/" title="Ti-Tri: Assembled for Wood Burning by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3387/3207579947_d668d4728e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ti-Tri: Assembled for Wood Burning" /></a>\n\nThe Ti-Tri\'s third fuel option are esbit tabs, which uses Trail Design\'s GramCracker. The GramCracker <ah ref="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208435632/in/set-72157612681073007/">consists of three pieces of titanium: two sides and a stand. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207591137/in/set-72157612681073007/">The sides pieces are slid into either side of the stand</a>, which then holds the esbit tab.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207597271/" title="Trail Designs GramCracker and Esbit by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3207597271_341921a6b4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Trail Designs GramCracker and Esbit" /></a>\n\nThis setup directs the heat for a much more efficient burn than that offered by a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/2877399740/in/set-72157607433043270/">standard esbit stove</a>. (The GramCracker also comes with a small piece of foil to be used as a base, but since I already carry the larger base for wood burning, I leave this smaller piece at home.) With the GramCracker assembled, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208455000/in/set-72157612681073007/">the cone is placed on top</a>, and the pot is nested just as with the alcohol stove.\n\nThe Ti-Tri also comes with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207610505/in/set-72157612681073007/">an 8 oz fuel bottle and measuring cup</a>. The measuring cup holds 1 oz and has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208460974/in/set-72157612681073007/">measurements marked in various units on all sides</a>. The fuel bottle itself is the best I\'ve found for alcohol. It has a tight screw lid that prevents any leaking (unlike those little Nalgene dispenser bottles), but also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208463538/in/set-72157612681073007/">provides a plug with a small hole</a> that allows one to fill the measuring cup (or the stove directly) much easier than it is to pour without such a plug.\n\nToday, I was planning on using the Ti-Tri as an alcohol stove. Trail Designs claims that the Ti-Tri can bring 2 cups of water to a boil with 15ml of alcohol. I\'ve found that 15ml brings 2 cups to more of a simmer. For a boil, you\'d want 25ml. I didn\'t measure exactly how much water I poured into the pot, so I decided to use a bit over 20ml of fuel.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207619585/" title="Measuring Cup and Alcohol by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/3207619585_f1695a1d35.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Measuring Cup and Alcohol" /></a>\n\nTea, today, would be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207623469/">Doug Fir and Cedar</a>. After pouring the the fuel from the measuring cup into the stove, I lit the 12-10 with a match, tossed on the cone, settled in the pot (after getting the handle mountings caught on the edge of the cone), and shifted my attentions elsewhere. I didn\'t time it this time around, but I think it burned for a bit over 10 minutes. My water was brought to a full, rolling boil -- much more than I really needed just for tea, but I was just out for a day-hike, so I wasn\'t terribly concerned with fuel conservation. After the burn, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208488752/in/set-72157612681073007/">I tossed the Doug Fir and Cedar into the pot to steep</a> and settled in for some tea and poetry.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208497482/" title="Tea and Poetry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3487/3208497482_cc643d4f31.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Tea and Poetry" /></a>\n\nOverall, the Ti-Tri comes in at just under 10oz. It\'s not the lightest or most compact alcohol stove setup, but seems to me to be extremely efficient. It\'s a bit like the JetBoil of the alcohol stove world. Of course, the Ti-Tri\'s primary advantage over other alcohol stoves is that it is not an alcohol stove: it\'s an alcohol stove, esbit stove, and wood stove. Having three different fuel options in your pack (and at such a light weight) is quite an invaluable thing. I\'m greatly looking forward to further use and testing of what has become my primary cooking system.\n\nThe Ti-Tri is a somewhat new product, but has already garnered some positive press, such as a <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/2008_bpl_staff_picks.html#Chris_Townsend">2008 Backpacking Light Staff Pick</a>. I\'m quite curious as to how the system\'s wood burning compares to that of the <a href="http://www.bushbuddy.ca/indexs.html">Bush Buddy</a>.\n\nCheck out <a href="http://traildesigns.com/gallery09.html">Trail Design\'s gallery</a> for photos further photos of the Ti-Tri in use, including at -20 degrees Fahrenheit in the Yukon.\n\nToday\'s post brought to you by: that feeling you get when you dangle your legs over a precipice that could probably kill you. And blue skies.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3207654087/" title="Blue Skies by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/3207654087_6685081a98.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Blue Skies" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>\nBed in the bush with stars to see,\nBread I dip in the river --\nThere\'s the life for a man like me,\nThere\'s the life for ever.\n\nfrom The Vagabond, Robert Louis Stevenson\n</blockquote></ah>'

After the burn, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208488752/in/set-72157612681073007/">I tossed the Doug Fir and Cedar into the pot to steep</a> and settled in for some tea and poetry.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3208497482/" title="Tea and Poetry by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3487/3208497482_cc643d4f31.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Tea and Poetry" /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the Ti-Tri comes in at just under 10oz. It&#8217;s not the lightest or most compact alcohol stove setup, but seems to me to be extremely efficient. It&#8217;s a bit like the JetBoil of the alcohol stove world. Of course, the Ti-Tri&#8217;s primary advantage over other alcohol stoves is that it is not an alcohol stove: it&#8217;s an alcohol stove, esbit stove, and wood stove. Having three different fuel options in your pack (and at such a light weight) is quite an invaluable thing. I&#8217;m greatly looking forward to further use and testing of what has become my primary cooking system.</p>\n<p>The Ti-Tri is a somewhat new product, but has already garnered some positive press, such as a <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/2008_bpl_staff_picks.html#Chris_Townsend">2008 Backpacking Light Staff Pick</a>.

It&#8217;s far lighter and more versatile than the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/2877399740/in/set-72157607433043270/">Esbit stove</a>. I haven&#8217;t even looked at my Jetboil since purchasing the Triad. The stove burns both denatured alcohol and fuel tabs, giving it a wider operating potential than most stoves that burn only either one or the other. My experience with alcohol stoves is limited, so I can&#8217;t compare the burn efficiency of the Triad to its competitors, but I, so far, have zero complaints.</p>\n<div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3126651450/" title="Trail Designs Vari-Vent Wind Screen by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/3126651450_5122cee550_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Trail Designs Vari-Vent Wind Screen" /></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s the slightest breeze out, the Triad will require a windscreen when burning alcohol (fuel tabs aren&#8217;t quite as susceptible). Vargo provides <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/store/pages.php?pID=4&amp;CDpath=1">instructions and a diagram</a> for building a windscreen yourself.

The daily temperatures have been hovering in the low 20s Fahrenheit (that\'s somewhere around -5 for you centigrade folks), with high winds and plenty of snow. I\'ve been out hiking every day, practicing winter fire lighting and taking advantage of the snow for tracking. It\'s also provided ample opportunity to test out the wool pants I bought a few months ago.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3119342152/" title="Wool Pants: Front by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/3119342152_7fd1540760.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wool Pants: Front" /></a>\n\nThey\'re surplus from the West German army, circa 1976. I acquired them on ebay for $20.\n\nThey have a standard 6 pocket design. The back pockets and two side pockets have button closure flaps. The cargo pockets have flaps with two button closures: one in the middle and one on the back. The front edge of the pocket flap is actually sewn onto the pants, which prevents the flap from, you know, flapping. It encourages the flap to stay closed, even when both the buttons are undone, providing for somewhat secure storage while still having instant access. On the outside of each cargo pocket is a smaller, 3" wide pocket with no closure. It was probably originally meant for a magazine, but is a perfect size for a cell phone or camera. It\'s a little small for my compass or GPS.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3118512549/" title="Wool Pants: Cargo Pocket by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3186/3118512549_ee0b55fe9c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wool Pants: Cargo Pocket" /></a>\n\nThe front of the pants is reinforced roughly 7" above the knee to 7" below.

Buttons are easier to replace in the field, but makes access a little slower. Annoying when nature calls. There\'s also a series of buttons along the waistband, both on the inside and the outside. Some of these can be used to make minute adjustments to the waist size, others just seem to be spares. In all, there\'s probably about 10 buttons that could be salvaged to repair the crotch or pocket closures. On the inside back of the waist band, there\'s also attachments for suspenders.\n\nOn the hem of each leg, there\'s are snaps that allow the legs to be tightened and the excess material folded, useful for blousing the pants with boots or for wearing under gaiters.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3119341184/" title="Wool Pants: Side by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3127/3119341184_c585feae8b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Wool Pants: Side" /></a>\n\nI love these pants. I received them in new condition, and their worth could easily be placed upward of $60. My only complaint is the button crotch, which I would prefer to be zippered.\n\nIn the cold (and somewhat wet) snow, I\'ve been staying perfectly warm and dry with these and a pair of merino wool long underwear worn underneath. In slightly warmer weather, I\'ve found the wool to be soft enough to be worn without the underwear underneath. (I haven\'t ever worn US Army surplus wool, but I\'m told that the West German stuff is softer. I\'ve also been told that wool from the former Eastern Bloc is the itchiest, and warned to stay well away from it.)\n\nI\'d recommend the West German wool to anyone. When passing someone on the trail decked out in plastic from head-to-toe, making that annoying <em>swish-swish-swish</em> sound as they walk by, you can chuckle to yourself, content in the knowledge that you are warmer, quieter and more comfortable in your wool.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3118511551/" title="I\'ll see you on the trail... by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/3118511551_a6deacd133.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="I\'ll see you on the trail..." /></a>'

One of his videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s16uOV1IsV4">features his knife</a>, the BCNW-O1. It has a very similar design to the slightly larger Skookum, which make it difficult for me to decide which I preferred.\n\nThe knife was listed as back-ordered on Mike\'s web page, so in the beginning of September I emailed him, asking when the knives would become available. My intention was that I would purchase whichever of the two knives became available first. Mike initially told me 2 weeks. That got delayed to 2 months, due to a batch of special order knives with a sharper grind coming in first and his moving the school to a new location. Still, it was available sooner than the Skookum, so I decided on the BCNW-O1.\n\nIt was well worth the wait. I couldn\'t be happier with the knife.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n(The plus side of the knife being back ordered is that the money had been sitting in a savings account, gaining interest since August.)\n\nAs the name implies, the BCNW-O1 is made of O1 tool steel. O1 is a relatively high maintenance material, somewhat soft when compared to other metals such as A2, and more prone to rust if not properly cared for. But the steel can be more easily sharpened to a razor edge than others, and can strike a spark off the backspine with a piece of flint (in addition to the more common ferrocerium rod). Because of this, O1 is quite popular in many bushcraft knives, including the famed <a href="http://www.raymears.com/Bushcraft_Product/72-Woodlore-Knife/">Woodlore knife</a>.\n\nThe knife is of the classic, Scandinavian design preferred by bushcrafters. The specs, taken from the <a href="http://www.shop.bushcraftnorthwest.com/product.sc?categoryId=2&productId=27">product page</a>, are as followed:\n<ul>\n<li>5/32" (3.9 mm) thick O1 tool steel</li>\n<li>RC 59</li>\n<li>3 5/8" (9.3cm) Scandi grind blade (grind done by Daniel Koster)</li>\n<li>8" (20.3cm) overall length</li>\n<li>Full tang</li>\n</ul>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3033756400/" title="BCNW-O1 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img class="thumb right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/3033756400_087d57ffc9_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="BCNW-O1" /></a>\n\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of the knife is the handle. It\'s made of bamboo "that has been processed much like micarta. The individual fibers are separated and then bound together under pressure with an industrial strength, formaldehyde-free adhesive. This material can withstand 3,000 psi and is very resistant to the elements while being made from a sustainable resource." The handle is very smooth, lacking the unique texture of micarta. It feels more like a normal wooden handle, which I love. One of the things that I don\'t think is demonstrated very well by the <a href="http://www.bushcraftnorthwest.com/BCNW-O1/BCNW-O1.htm">photos on the Bushcraft Northwest site</a> is the size of the handle. It\'s a bit bigger and chunkier than what it looks like, which provides for a very comfortable grip. It fits perfectly in my hand.\n\n(While Bamboo can be grown and harvested sustainably, many of the processing methods that go into turning it into clothing are extremely toxic and environmentally destructive. I have no idea about the process that goes into making this handle, but I don\'t figure it to be any more environmentally friendly than micarta. Maybe I\'m wrong, but I think you should probably avoid any synthetic or processed handle material if you\'re concerned about such things.)\n\nIn addition the the handle material, the thumb scallops that are carved into either side of the handle are rather unique. This is an excellent feature that assists in certain carving grips, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s16uOV1IsV4">demonstrated in Mike\'s video</a>.\n\nThe knife comes with a leather Scandinavian style sheath (available either with or without a firesteel holder) made by <a href="http://www.jreindustries.com/">JRE Industries</a>. I\'ve used one of these with my Mora knives for a couple years and greatly prefer them over any other style I\'ve tried.\n\nMost any bushcraft knife made today owes its design, in some part, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mors_Kochanski">Mors Kochanski</a>. Though not as well known as Ray Mears, Kochanski in generally considered to be the father of modern bushcraft. In the spirit of Schwert\'s <a href="http://outdoors.free.fr/OM-PDF/Knives/Skookum-Bush-Tool-by-Rod-Garcia.pdf">introduction to the Skookum Bush Tool</a> in <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/11/14/outdoors-magazine-mirror/">Outdoors Magazine</a>, I\'ll introduce the BCNW-O1 with excerpts from the Knifecraft chapter of Mors Kochanski\'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1551051222">Bushcraft</a>.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3033830120/" title="BCNW-O1 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/3033830120_7d3827c2af.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="BCNW-O1" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe general-purpose bush knife should have a blade as long as the width of the palm, although blades half or twice this length are within acceptable limits. A blade five centimeters long would be an excellent survival knife except for being too small to fall and limb trees of wrist-thickness. A blade 10 to 15 centimeters  long will do intricate work like carving a netting needle, yet be large enough to present a good target for a baton when cutting down small trees. A blade 20 centimeters long is a superior tool for heavy work, but awkward to use for fine work. \n</blockquote>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3033753126/" title="BCNW-O1 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/3033753126_89d07fd672.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="BCNW-O1" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>\nAll general-use knives should have the blade tip close to the profile centerline of the handle. The back of the handle and the back of the blade should be on the same line. The back of the blade should not be thinned down or sharpened so that a baton can be used more effectively without being cut up. There is no advantage to a two-edged blade in bush living. \n</blockquote>\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/3032908953/" title="BCNW-O1 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3051/3032908953_4cbc26b20f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="BCNW-O1" /></a>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe blade should be of a good quality carbon steel, from two and a half to three millimeters thick and about two to two and a half centimeters wide. This size of blade is light in weight, yet difficult to break.  The steel should be soft enough to be maintained at a shaving edge with common sharpening tools, without frequent sharpening. Such steel is found in Mora (Sweden), Solingen (Germany) or Sheffield (England) knives. Carbon, unlike stainless steel, can be used as the striker in the flint and steel method of fire-lighting. Inexpensive stainless steels have had a bad reputation with respect to producing a keen edge let alone holding it.

It has a very similar design to the slightly larger Skookum, which make it difficult for me to decide which I preferred.</p>\n<p>The knife was listed as back-ordered on Mike&#8217;s web page, so in the beginning of September I emailed him, asking when the knives would become available. My intention was that I would purchase whichever of the two knives became available first. Mike initially told me 2 weeks. That got delayed to 2 months, due to a batch of special order knives with a sharper grind coming in first and his moving the school to a new location. Still, it was available sooner than the Skookum, so I decided on the BCNW-O1.</p>\n<p>It was well worth the wait. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the knife.</p>'

    vellum_post_146.body = u'Last month, <a href="http://vavrek.com/">vavrek</a> and I began researching gravity powered water filtration systems. The British Berkefeld and Berkey filter systems dominate this market (British Berkefeld refers to systems using the <a href="http://www.jamesfilter.com/doultonsuper.html">Doulton Super Sterasyl filter elements</a>, Berkey refers to filter systems using the <a href="http://jamesfilter.com/berkeyblack.aspx">Black Berkey filter elements</a>). I had been set on purchasing a Berkey filter until vavrek discovered <a href="http://www.aquarain.com/">AquaRain Natural Water Filtration Systems</a>, a lesser known (and cheaper) alternative.\n\nThe AquaRain systems are all built in the USA from stainless steel. The filter elements are from <a href="http://www.silverdyn.com/newmara/home.html">Marathon Filters</a>, the same used by <a href="http://www.msrgear.com/">MSR</a> in their portable filters. They\'re ceramic with carbon which, <a href="http://www.aquatechnology.net/ceramicfiltration.html">as illustrated in this table</a>, filters organic and microbiological organisms, but not heavy metals, radioactivity, or inorganics. (More information on different filter types is <a href="http://www.whentechfails.com/node/27">available here</a>.) These filters have been shown to filter down to the .2-.3 micron range, where British Berkefeld units claim an absolute rating of .5 microns.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<a href="http://www.nitro-pak.com/aquarain-drip-filter">Nitro-Pak</a>, a seller of AquaRain filters, has the following to say concerning manufacturer claims of "absolute" micron ratings:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere is a great deal of confusion regarding "absolute" micron ratings. Just how much of a reduction efficiency should be considered adequate for an "absolute" rating? Is 99.9% (3 log) sufficient, or would 99.9999% (6 log) be more appropriate, since it matches the EPA bacteria requirement? Should a filter be rated by its ability to remove particles of a certain size, or shouldit be challenged with live organisms of a particular size? Should a filter be tested only when it is new, or should the ratings be based on its end-of-life performance? The fact is that there is no industry or government standard for "absolute" filtration performance.\n\nThe Marathon filter elements used in the AquaRain Gravity Water Filter have been extensively tested against live organisms using expended end-of-life elements. We believe this form of testing to be the most stringent, since it tests the filters in a manner similar to the way they would actually be used under worst case conditions. When testing against the .5-.6 micron organism Klebsiella terrigena, EXPENDED Marathon elements demonstrated a 6.6 log reduction (they achieved 8.9 log reduction when new). The EPA only requires a 6 log reduction from NEW elements, which AquaRain greatly exceeded under extreme pressures of up to 90 psi, well above normal test pressure. At the very low pressure of 1/2 psi found in our gravity filter, the efficacy would be far greater still. Does this mean that the Marathon filter elements have an "absolute" rating of only .5-.6 microns? Expended Marathon filter elements have also been tested against the Health Industry Manufacturing Association\'s (HIMA) test organism, Brevundimonas diminuta, and achieved a 99.99815% reduction (99.9999% when new). Since this organism is .2-.3 micron, should we claim this as our "absolute" rating? British Berkefeld Filter literature lists the "absolute" rating of their filter at .9 microns and their U.S. dealers claim "absolute" performance at .5 microns. Their own factory literature claims only 99.9% efficiency at the .5 micron level. Is 99.9% sufficient for claiming an "absolute" rating? The bottom line is that the AquaRain Gravity Water Filter System, using Marathon filter elements, will outperform all other gravity-fed ceramic water filter systems. Since there is no standard for "absolute," YOU will have to decide what level of protection you want for yourself and your family.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe AquaRain, British Berkefeld, and Berkey filter systems are all worthy investments. Finding a clear winner between the three can prove a challenge. Based partly on the above quote concerning micron ranges, partly on the price, and partly on the country of origin, I decided to purchase an AquaRain.\n\nI went with the AquaRain 202 model. It includes two filter elements and holds roughly 1.5 gallons of clean water. I purchased it from <a href="http://www.campingsurvival.com/aqmo202wafi.html">CampingSurvival.com</a>, who, after factoring in shipping costs and using the coupon code "savings" for a 5% discount, had the 202 for the cheapest I could find. I\'d never dealt with them before, but their shipping and email response was prompt, so I\'d recommend them if you\'re looking to pick up an AquaRain.\n\nWhen you first receive the AquaRain, all the parts should be thoroughly cleaned and the filter elements "cultured" by rinsing them under water and running your hands along them. The system is then assembled, which is a simple process of installing the spigot on the lower reservoir, the two filter elements in the top reservoir, and the handle on the lid. Finally, stack the top reservoir atop the lower, dump in some water, put on the lid, and you\'re done.\n\nRegardless of the actual micron measurement, pores in the AquaRain\'s Marathon filters are smaller than those in the Berkefeld, which makes for a slower flow rate. AquaRain claims a 1/4 gallon per hour per element flow rate under ideal conditions. New filter elements are nowhere near this fast. When I first put my system together, I filled the top reservoir and left for 5 hours. Upon returning, only about 1/6th of the water had made it through the two filters. I emailed AquaRain to confirm that this was normal behavior.\n\n<blockquote>Yes this may very well fit into the normal range when first starting it up....\n \nThe filters are DRY and the pores on the surface of the ceramics are very small.  The water follows a tortuous path to get to the bed of the granulated activated carbon....also DRY... and then it drips into the lower container.\n \nWithin a couple of days, the filters will have become fully saturated.  When you keep the container filled (adding water every ten or so minutes) you can then achieve the optimum filtration rate.  Most people will not give the unit this kind of attention....most will fill it before they go to bed at night and by morning you should have a gallon or so.  Fill again for more water.  Even when keeping the unit full and striving for the high filtration rate, the water has a nominal contact time of 11 minutes with the carbon...this is good!  You want it slow so that it can do its job.  (Another factor, especially with cold weather coming, that affects speed of filtration is the temperature of the water....the warmer the faster....the colder the slower.\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is important to note that the top reservoir simply sits on top of the lower, with no rubber "O" ring to make the connection water tight. This means that it is possible for the lower reservoir to overflow if you attempt to keep the top constantly full for maximum flow rate without emptying the bottom (I discovered this the hard way).\n\nThe water filtered through the AquaRain does have a distinctly different taste. I live in a city that has some of the cleanest water in the state, and I\'ve always used a Brita water filter for drinking water. I expected the AquaRain to do a much better job than the cheap Brita, but I did not expect a significant difference in taste. The water from the AquaRain tastes much smoother, for lack of a better descriptor. I\'ve also noticed the water comes to a boil faster when cooking.\n\nI keep a 1 gallon glass jug full of filtered water in the fridge for chilled drinking water. For cooking and for tea, I take the water directly from the AquaRain. I lift up the upper reservoir periodically throughout the day to check the water level, and dump a bit in the top when the lower is lacking. (I prefer to fill the top at night, so that I can go to sleep to the "drip drip" sound of the filtered water falling into the pool in the bottom). Because I never completely fill the top, I don\'t achieve the maximum flow rate.\n\nFor 1-2 people looking for clean drinking and cooking water, I think the AquaRain 202 model is ideal. For 3-4 people, I would certainly opt for the larger 404 model. If you\'re looking to provide water for more than 4 people, I\'d speculate that you would need to either pick up multiple 404 models or acquire a couple of large buckets and <a href="http://www.alpharubicon.com/kids/homemadeberkeydaire.htm">build your own filter</a> with perhaps 6-8 filter elements to achieve an optimum flow rate.\n\nIn an off-grid (or grid-down survival) situation where clean water is needed not only for drinking and cooking but also for cleaning, I would certainly want to invest in some large water storage containers and perhaps a 404 model for the faster filtration rate achieved by the 4 filter elements. But that would be for 1-2 people. If you\'re looking for a system to provide drinking, cooking, and cleaning water for 4 or more people, I don\'t think an AquaRain system is practical. Ideally, I would try for a large scale rain-water fed rapid-sand filter leading to a slow-sand filter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1592281273/">described in Aric McBay\'s Peak Oil Survival</a>) -- and if you happen to have an AquaRain, perhaps using that for final filtration of drinking water.\n\nAquaRain recommends dumping the first 1-2 gallons filtered through new filter elements, "as it may contain loose material washed from the filter elements." This, along with the extremely slow flow-rate of new filter elements creates an interesting conundrum. Because the new filters are dry, it takes a significant amount of time for the first couple gallons of water to be filtered. The two filter elements in my AquaRain 202 took a little over 24 hours. If I were off-grid and completely dependent on the AquaRain, that\'s 24 hours without the ability to produce usable water every time I change the filter elements. Storing enough water for 24 hours isn\'t a big deal (and really ought to be a minimum requirement), but what if some event were to arise that requires me to use more than the usual amount of water? It seems to me that one should strive for two different filter systems -- to be used concurrently, but staggered -- so that when new filters are being installed and conditioned in one, you can fall back to the other.\n\nOne of the main concerns many city-dwellers hold about their water supply these days is the possibility of it being contaminated with fluoride. (There\'s a rather heated debate as to whether fluoride is good or bad. Personally, I believe it to be a poison, but I think the debate is mute. Cities should provide the cleanest, purest water possible to its citizens. If an individual wishes to add some additional chemical to their water, they can do that themselves, at their own risk, in their own homes.) Because of this, a popular addition to Berkey filters are the <a href="http://www.morethanalive.com/PF-2-Arsenic-and-Fluoride-Reduction-Elements">Post Filter Arsenic and Fluoride Reduction Elements</a>, which screw on to the Black Berkey filter elements. In my city, we voted down the attempt to fluoridate our water supply, so it isn\'t an immediate concern for me. But chances are that at some point I\'ll live in a place that does poison its water. Before deciding on the AquaRain over the Berkey filters, I emailed AquaRain and asked if the Post Filter elements would also fit onto their Marathon filters. They replied in the negative:\n\n<blockquote>\nFluoride is a difficult thing to remove from water, and gravity carbon filter systems may not be the most efficient or effective way to do the job. If you use a gravity water filter system that has carbon in its operation, a more accurate word would be reduce rather than remove. Carbon is generally not the accepted media for fluoride reduction and our unit has not been specifically tested again fluoride to see how significant the reduction can be. There are variables involved with certain chemicals. For example: We do not know how much fluoride has been added to your water system; there would be a sliding scale of effectiveness as the carbon ages, etc. \n\nHowever, we know the water passes slowly through the AquaRain (which is positive since you want the contact time to be as long as possible.) We have found documents that say carbon will reduce fluoride enough (up to 80%) that pro-fluoride people are alarmed and want you to add it back into your diet.  If your main concern is fluoride removal/reduction, there may be better options out there than a gravity water filter system. (Reverse Osmosis).\n\nNot to discount the danger of fluoride, sadly and statistically, all of the strengths found in the AquaRain filter system...bacteria, cysts, protozoan removal, VOC contaminants, chlorine, benzene, pharmaceutical drug removal can be accomplished with the AquaRain but most people do not even know of these dangers.\n\nDue to the thread pattern found on the stems of the AquaRain Ceramics, there are no post filters that will fit our candles.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis wasn\'t enough to dissuade me from the AquaRain systems. Up to 80% reduction ain\'t bad, but I think some sort of reverse osmosis system (or just going for rain collection) would be justified if I find myself in a fluoride-friendly city.\n\nI\'ve been very pleased with the AquaRain for the week that I\'ve been using it. Tangibles such as water filters are not only wise investments of wealth in uncertain economic times, they also allow a further degree of self-sufficiency. Though I currently fill the AquaRain with tap water, I can just as easily fill it with water from the more-than-abundant rains we receive here in the Pacific Northwest. I\'m no longer fully dependent on city water, nor subject to another\'s whims as to what should be in my water.'

If you use a gravity water filter system that has carbon in its operation, a more accurate word would be reduce rather than remove. Carbon is generally not the accepted media for fluoride reduction and our unit has not been specifically tested again fluoride to see how significant the reduction can be. There are variables involved with certain chemicals. For example: We do not know how much fluoride has been added to your water system; there would be a sliding scale of effectiveness as the carbon ages, etc.\n\nHowever, we know the water passes slowly through the AquaRain (which is positive since you want the contact time to be as long as possible.) We have found documents that say carbon will reduce fluoride enough (up to 80%) that pro-fluoride people are alarmed and want you to add it back into your diet.  If your main concern is fluoride removal/reduction, there may be better options out there than a gravity water filter system. (Reverse Osmosis).\n\nNot to discount the danger of fluoride, sadly and statistically, all of the strengths found in the AquaRain filter system&#8230;bacteria, cysts, protozoan removal, VOC contaminants, chlorine, benzene, pharmaceutical drug removal can be accomplished with the AquaRain but most people do not even know of these dangers.\n\nDue to the thread pattern found on the stems of the AquaRain Ceramics, there are no post filters that will fit our candles.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis wasn&#8217;t enough to dissuade me from the AquaRain systems. Up to 80% reduction ain&#8217;t bad, but I think some sort of reverse osmosis system (or just going for rain collection) would be justified if I find myself in a fluoride-friendly city.\n\nI&#8217;ve been very pleased with the AquaRain for the week that I&#8217;ve been using it. Tangibles such as water filters are not only wise investments of wealth in uncertain economic times, they also allow a further degree of self-sufficiency. Though I currently fill the AquaRain with tap water, I can just as easily fill it with water from the more-than-abundant rains we receive here in the Pacific Northwest. I&#8217;m no longer fully dependent on city water, nor subject to another&#8217;s whims as to what should be in my water.'

During my short time on the walk, the Camino gave me what it could, and I gladly accept the gift, but I felt the remaining miles had nothing more to offer.\n\nFollowing the Camino\'s yellow arrows day after day, while comforting in their promise of direction and safety, is too structured an experience. This, the cultivated landscape, and the crowds of walkers contribute to a feeling of limitation.\n\nI seek to find my own paths, and to forge my own way. Only by traveling into the unknown can we explore our selves. And so, despite the cultural differences, despite the linguistic barrier, and despite the unknown country, I think the Camino is flawed. There are no yellow arrows for the mind, save for those we paint our selves.\n\nFor me, it must be a journey wilder than this. One for which I do not have my way painted upon the landscape. A journey in which I am dependent on the self, alone in a solitary wilderness. To explore that is to touch the crevices of consciousness, running one\'s finger upon the peculiar bumps of its surface.\n\nFrom the 21st of June till the 1st of July, I walked, taking a day off in Pamplona and in Viana. In Logrono, I spent 3 nights before taking a train back to Madrid, where I\'ve been for the past week.\n\nI continue my pilgrimage elsewhere.\n\n<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157606125091312/" title="IMG_1716 by Pig Monkey, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2199/2661192273_8d6382e266.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1716" /></a>'

This, the cultivated landscape, and the crowds of walkers contribute to a feeling of limitation.</p>\n<p>I seek to find my own paths, and to forge my own way. Only by traveling into the unknown can we explore our selves. And so, despite the cultural differences, despite the linguistic barrier, and despite the unknown country, I think the Camino is flawed. There are no yellow arrows for the mind, save for those we paint our selves.</p>\n<p>For me, it must be a journey wilder than this. One for which I do not have my way painted upon the landscape. A journey in which I am dependent on the self, alone in a solitary wilderness. To explore that is to touch the crevices of consciousness, running one&#8217;s finger upon the peculiar bumps of its surface.</p>\n<p>From the 21st of June till the 1st of July, I walked, taking a day off in Pamplona and in Viana.

    vellum_post_157.body = u'The Christian story of Genesis is a creation myth central to the Western construction of the self. It involves, as its central theme, a fall from grace. As Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, they gain knowledge. The first flaw they perceive is their own body -- the shame of nakedness. The couple is then booted from paradise, their imperfect bodies more suited to imperfect surroundings. In the East, Hinduism sets as a central doctrine a strict caste system of cleanliness, reminding followers daily of their imperfection in relation to each other and the gods. Today, technologists such as the Venturists seek to improve the human condition by achieving immortality. Whether through a fall from grace, our very creation, or simply in our own mortality, humans perceive themselves as imperfect. As a life progresses, these flaws build in both number and import. Children, with innocence not yet lost to the count of years, are seen as closer to perfection. But adults: both in the flesh and in the mind, we are flawed. We seek to perfect these flaws by augmenting our reality. It is a yearning for innocence, not as naivete or lack of guilt, but as a kind of amoral, infinite perfection: the innocence of a god. This quest for innocence is achieved through perfected representations of our selves and through a perfection of our surroundings. At its highest level, our augmented reality reaches a state of hyperreality: the nonreal -- its borders blurred -- inside the unbounded real.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe quest for innocence, in its most simple form, may be demonstrated by a doll: a humanoid carved from wood, or molded from clay, with its potential for perfect symmetry; an idealized projection of the self. The doll is not idealized only in exaggerated or perfected form, but also in its very nature. It does not age, does not die, does not bleed or ever go wanting for sustenance. It is a blank slate, an amoral immortal. Whatever emotions, intentions, or knowledge we have (or lack) may be attributed to these creations. By creating dolls, we manifest our ideal into reality. Transforming these dolls into puppets transcends further boundaries.\n\n"Nothing can endure if it is not \'animated,\' if it is not... endowed with a \'soul\' [Eliada 2005:20]". As a puppet, the figurine is granted the illusion of autonomous movement. Animation is the act of writing aemaeth on the golem\'s forehead, bringing the clay figure to life. Through this animation, the doll -- the theophany -- becomes a more convincing illusion. It is the life giving breath. Indeed, the word animate springs from <em>anima</em>, the Greek word for soul [Sharp 2004]. As the ever-observant Oscar Wilde humorously points out, these puppets are superior to humans. "There are many advantages in puppets. They never argue. They have no crude views about art. They have no private lives" [Wilde]. They are not subject to the same imperfections as us. Instead, they reach closer to innocence.\n\nAs our technology increases, so do our projections. The art of the doll progressed from clay molding or wood carving to the ball-jointed, pubescent females of Hans Bellmer. Yet our technological creations allow us to take our projections even further.\n\nToday, the doll is replaced with the android. These humanoid robots, with realistic skin, hair, and movement, can create a creature so real as to be disturbing. It is the recreation of the human, without the fleshy parts. Like the doll, the android is an amoral, immortal simulacra.\n\nIn 2005, Japanese roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro unveiled Repliee Q1Expo, a female android. Repliee has silicone skin, motors that simulate breathing, and the ability to flutter its eyes. When demonstrating Repliee, Ishiguro found that although it was obvious that the android was just that, people interacting with her (if I may assign the machine a gender) unconsciously wanted to believe that she was real. "More importantly, we have found that people forget she is an android while interacting with her. Consciously, it is easy to see that she is an android, but unconsciously, we react to the android as if she were a woman" [Whitehouse 2005]. This reaction to the machine may be attributed to her appearance: she appears as real as the doll. Repliee represents innocence. Like the doll, she is the human form perfected, if degraded in her intelligence.\n\nThe following year, Hiroshi Ishiguro unveiled his latest work: Geminoid HI-1. Created in his own image, Geminoid repeats the realism of Repliee, but this time integrating telepresence into the machine, so that Ishiguro can control and speak through the android remotely, creating a simulated intelligence [Hornyak 2006]. With this system, the human interactor need no longer slip into the unconscious to treat the android as if it was a man. The tele-present intelligence matches human intelligence, as does the mechanical body match in appearance the organic body, to make the bot completely believable in its form.\n\nRaised from the pages of science fiction possibilities, as an external, idealized entity with which we interact, Geminoid HI-1 functions as a perfected being. But the doll or android alone could never fulfill our lustful search for innocence. It is only a unidimensional projection of perfection, not perfection itself. Our surroundings, our reality, remains limited and flawed, "too small for human imagination" [Laurel 1992:87]. In the quest for innocence, we must turn to a full-scale modification of our reality. The android raises possibilities in this direction. It not only allows us to fulfill the common wish of the industrial capitalist to be in two places at once, but also promises a manifestation in physical form of our idealized avatar, not simply one stagnant, but one through which we can act, interact, and even live. It is a titillating hint of the possibility of full cyborgization. But before the avatar can be manifest as an objective form that we would consider real, it must first be explored and constructed elsewhere. It must be placed within a perfected environment. Virtual reality allows us this possibility.\n\nIn the words of Brenda Laurel, virtual reality is a "manifestation of the age-old desire to make our fantasies palpable -- our insatiable need to exercise our imagination, judgment, and spirit in world, situations, and personae that are different from our everyday lives" [Laurel 1992:87]. The earliest form of this is the moving picture, that "most beautiful fraud" [Wikipedia 2008]. Entering the darkened cinema, senses not required for the visual experience are themselves dimmed. We find ourselves immersed in the action on screen. Our emotions are tied to those mythic characters who appear human, save for in the way which would expel them from the virtual reality of the silver screen and link them with us; save for their achievement of innocence. The troubles of the characters end up solved, they do not bleed, perhaps they can even fly. Their world is clean, everything perfected for the action of the character. It is a constructed Eden. Preserved on celluloid or silicon, the forms are immortal. With computers, we are able to intimately control these characters. The level of realism is increased another mark.\n\nIn the modern virtual environment (rendered or not), we act out our own wants and desires. A perfected avatar within a perfected environment. Death is preventable -- we need only yell "Reset!" to boot ourselves out of peril [Oshii 2001] -- but if it does occur, it is only a minor setback. We have powers and possibilities not available in the world of our daily experience. With enough time and effort, perhaps we ourselves can even become god-like, leveling up and reaching ever so much higher than ever before. Rather than only observing our perfected abstractions, such as with dolls, virtual reality allows action to take place through them, and it facilitates this within a constructed paradise.\n\nAccessing the Internet is an integral part of this quest for regaining innocence. Plugging ourselves in, our consciousness melds with the vast global network. The darkness of the desert of the real disappears to the blinding light of cyberspace.  Our bounded consciousness is unleashed in to the greater nodal network. We may harvest data from an immense library of both knowledge and experience. The internet brings us closer to god: it is nothing short of the Tower of Babel, allowing all humanity to interact and, in that interaction, reach a more perfected state. Here, in this city of flowing light, we are all immortal entities, able to shift our perfected forms into any shape we see fit.\n\nBut the knowledge that this is a facade can never be lost. It ever looms over the experience, waiting to shock us rudely as we log out of the virtual world and enter the reality of everyday experience. We may plug ourselves in, but our consciousness remains aware that it is an experience bounded, with those borders separate from the borders of our daily reality. Enter hyperreality: a reality constructed with elements of the non-real. It is an augmented truth, which is in itself not a lie, but truth. Unlike virtual reality, fantasy is not bounded in the hyperreal. The reality fully stimulates the senses: the unconscious, and the conscious. With the ability to augment our reality without the need for a suspension of disbelief -- without the notion of disbelief itself -- we can climb to the very top of Nimrod\'s tower. Hyperreality, smugly, promises godliness.\n\nJean Baudrillard describes the hyperreal as "a real without origin or reality" [Baudrillard 1994:1]. He and other philosophers of the hyperreal draw on a short story penned by Jorge Luis Borges. In the story, the ruler of a vast empire causes a map of his territories to be drawn. It so detailed that the map was the very size of the empire. It covers the land, and becomes indistinguishable from the territory itself [Borges]. Baudrillard treats this fable as "the most beautiful allegory of simulation" [Baudrillard 1994:1], but in his analysis of the fable, Baudrillard claims that the difference between the map and the reality has disappeared. It is not that we mistake the map for the territory, but that there is no difference.\n\nUmberto Eco discusses the wax work museums of America as a simulacra demonstrative of a hyperreal experience. Here, "copies" of original paintings are presented, but fuller and more real than the original. They surpass and placate any desire to experience the original. These reproductions themselves become real. The lighting, music, and even the temperature of the room are all augmented to match the scene and provide a more full sensory experience. Imitations improving reality. The wax creations are simulacra: copies without originals [Eco 1990].\n\nThe hyperreality not only manifests our ideals, but integrates them into our own experience such that they become indistinguishable from truth -- indeed, such that they <em>become truth</em>. War by Hollywood and CNN. The American West sanitized, idealized, and regurgitated through John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. It promises a world which we can control completely -- solipsism in action, for even if the real is objective and separate from the mind, it can be reprogrammed completely to the liking of the individual. "[Hyperreality] surpasses traditional and natural reality in brilliance, richness, and pliability" [Borgmann 1992:83].\n\nHeinz Pagel offers an explanation for the existence of the simulacra of reality: "A good simulation... gives us a sense of mastery over our experience. To represent something symbolically, as we do when we speak or write, is somehow to capture it, thus making it one\'s own. But with this appropriation comes the realization that we have denied the immediacy of reality and that in creating a substitute we have but spun another thread into the web of our grand illusion" [Pagel 1989:88]. In that the simulation demonstrates mastery over the simulation, Pagel is correct. But he takes a dim view of this, relegating it to only "another thread" in a "grand illusion". He misses, it seems, that this mastery may not be an illusion -- or, rather, that the illusion ceases to be an illusion as it comes into existence. It is an altering of reality, not something fake, but as real as that which was altered.\n\nA critic of the post-human, N. Katherine Hayles claims that "hyperreality does not erase [the borders separating simulations from reality], for they exist whether we recognize them or not; it only erases them from our consciousness" [Hayles 1991]. Yet this seems only a description of virtual reality. Hyperreality is a stage further, also erasing the borders in our unconscious. It does not tread too close to solipsism, I think, to say that with both the conscious and unconscious blissfully unaware of the separation between simulation and reality, the distinction no longer exists. It is not ignoring the borders till they go away -- we do not know what to ignore in the first place. Erased from the mind, they are erased from existence.\n\nJennifer Cypher and Eric Higgs explore Disney\'s Wilderness Lodge in Orlando as an extreme hyperreality. It is crafted as a perfected conglomerate of National Park lodges from the American Northwest. "The real thing only better, wilderness without dirt or danger." Through its augmentation, this sanitized simulacra achieves dominance over the reality the lodge is modeled on -- but it is a real thing itself. To those who stay in the lodge, but never glimpse that which it is modeled on, the Wilderness Lodge is an accurate representation of reality, an irony of contradictions [Haraway 1991:434]. The totem poles, "stone inlaid with designs suggesting Navajo and Hopi blanket patterns", and "teepee-shaped light fixtures" are, like Disney\'s Native Americans in Peter Pan, artifacts of a history that wasn\'t quite, but through our story-telling, become real. And why shouldn\'t they? To forget the American government\'s perpetuation of genocide, to eliminate the mosquito from the forest: it is an agreeable rewriting of the truth. It makes our past, our present, and our future more bearable. As the authors write, "the lodge reproduces and represents something which does not exist... it is truly a copy without an original" [Cypher].\n\nAs our environment is improved, so too our selves. The body and the mind both live vicariously, augmenting their state and form in relation to perceived reality. We seek to drown ourselves in the amniotic ocean of the womb.\n\nMamoru Oshii explores hyperreality in his film <em>Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</em>. In the film\'s world, metal has meshed with meat such that cyborgs represent normality, and the organic human -- even one with a synthetic brain -- is the exception. Japan\'s culture, ever loving of its dolls, has progressed so that autonomous humanoid robots are common, filling functions both of work and pleasure. The film centers on a small law enforcement unit attempting to answer why a new model of androids have begun to self-destruct.  The world portrayed is a perfect hyperreality. The characters, as cyborgs, are ever jacked in to a seemingly infinite data network, allowing themselves to unbind their consciousness -- or ghosts, as the film has it. The fleshy parts of the human body have been replaced, so that while they tend still to maintain the appearance of humanoid normalcy, body parts are synthetic and mechanical; under warranty, owned, and able to be replaced or upgraded. When online, the character\'s vision of meatspace fuses seamlessly with the virtual world, negating the difference between the real and the virtual. Planes and submarines take on organic forms, with bird-like wings and fish-like fins [Oshii 2004]. It is a meshing of flesh and machine, an abomination.\n\nIn this hyperreality, the android dolls, often indistinguishable from the cyborg human, disrupt order by self-destructing or, as one character (modeled on cyborg theorist Donna Haraway) puts it, committing suicide. At film\'s end, the cyborg protagonist discovers that the android suicide is caused by the ghost in the shell. The doll manufacturer, seeking a cheaper and more believable alternative to artificial intelligence, had kidnapped children, copying their ghost into the cyber-brain of the dolls. As the ghost cannot exist in two places at once, this "ghost-dubbing" kills the child, effectively moving the child\'s consciousness into the doll. The children were not terribly thrilled by their forced shift from animal to machine, and kill themselves to draw attention to their plight.\n\nThe world of the film is, as the title suggests, an extreme representation of the technologically mediated quest for innocence. It shows us the doll become human, and the human become doll. Yet Oshii reveals that this quest for the abstraction of innocence both within the self and outside the self achieves only more flaws and imperfection.\n\nWith the body augmented by cybernetics, our humanness replaced with the post-human, and our identification not as a biological organism, but as a cyborg, we turn ourselves into dolls. Prolonged life, replaceable limbs. As we connect our minds to the vastness of a global computer network, our bounded consciousness spreads, transcending our meager human grey-matter. This hyperreal, cybernetic simulacra, projected by Oshii\'s film, is a convergence of the threads in our search for innocence. A melding of technologies and thought permeating the body and the environment [Laurel 2000]; information reprogrammed, augmenting our being, transcending our nature, reaching ever closer to the infinite mind of the universe.\n\nIn <em>The Myth of the Eternal Return</em>, Mircea Eliade illustrates an ontology for "archaic man". His analysis of primitive myth leads him to the conclusion that, in this archaic ontology, no action has meaning except in as much as it replicates the action of a mythic being "<em>in illo tempore</em>". He cites this as an attempt to return to an animal state of innocence; a "nostalgia for the lost paradise... [A paradise] with the image of an ideal humanity enjoying beatitude and spiritual plenitude forever unrealizable in the present state of \'fallen man\'... [A] very distant epoch when men knew neither death nor toil nor suffering" [Eliada 2005:3].\n\nEliade errs only in limiting his illustration to the Other. This yearning -- this nostalgia -- for innocence has not been limited to our ancestors or our primitive brethren. We are all creatures of myth. The quest is a phenomena that spans time and culture, weaving the whole of our species into a web of common human existence -- a "desperate effort not to lose contact with <em>being</em>" [Eliada 2005:3-92].\n\nYet with the possibilities offered by the technologies of today and tomorrow, the quest threatens to disconnect us from both our selves and our neighbors. The hyperreal, simulacra of an existence is no longer a way to live in the world, but a way to live outside of it. It is a product of a mythos that no longer resonates with our experience of being. Not until our experiences are justified by the sacred will we be satisfied with the profane. Rather than augmenting our experience, we must augment our myth. We need a new myth. A myth in which we are neither perfect nor fallen. A myth with the ability to live. Even within our literate culture -- a culture which often shuns oral, living documents -- we must dream a collective cosmology that can integrate itself into our existence and shift with the dynamic flowing of time.\n\n<h3>Works Cited</h3>\n\nBaudrillard, Jean.\n\t1994 Simulacra and Simulation.

Children, with innocence not yet lost to the count of years, are seen as closer to perfection. But adults: both in the flesh and in the mind, we are flawed. We seek to perfect these flaws by augmenting our reality. It is a yearning for innocence, not as naivete or lack of guilt, but as a kind of amoral, infinite perfection: the innocence of a god. This quest for innocence is achieved through perfected representations of our selves and through a perfection of our surroundings. At its highest level, our augmented reality reaches a state of hyperreality: the nonreal &#8212; its borders blurred &#8212; inside the unbounded real.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The quest for innocence, in its most simple form, may be demonstrated by a doll: a humanoid carved from wood, or molded from clay, with its potential for perfect symmetry; an idealized projection of the self. The doll is not idealized only in exaggerated or perfected form, but also in its very nature. It does not age, does not die, does not bleed or ever go wanting for sustenance. It is a blank slate, an amoral immortal. Whatever emotions, intentions, or knowledge we have (or lack) may be attributed to these creations. By creating dolls, we manifest our ideal into reality. Transforming these dolls into puppets transcends further boundaries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing can endure if it is not &#8216;animated,&#8217; if it is not&#8230; endowed with a &#8216;soul&#8217; [Eliada 2005:20]&#8221;. As a puppet, the figurine is granted the illusion of autonomous movement. Animation is the act of writing aemaeth on the golem&#8217;s forehead, bringing the clay figure to life. Through this animation, the doll &#8212; the theophany &#8212; becomes a more convincing illusion. It is the life giving breath. Indeed, the word animate springs from <em>anima</em>, the Greek word for soul [Sharp 2004]. As the ever-observant Oscar Wilde humorously points out, these puppets are superior to humans. &#8220;There are many advantages in puppets. They never argue. They have no crude views about art. They have no private lives&#8221; [Wilde]. They are not subject to the same imperfections as us. Instead, they reach closer to innocence.</p>\n<p>As our technology increases, so do our projections. The art of the doll progressed from clay molding or wood carving to the ball-jointed, pubescent females of Hans Bellmer. Yet our technological creations allow us to take our projections even further.</p>\n<p>Today, the doll is replaced with the android. These humanoid robots, with realistic skin, hair, and movement, can create a creature so real as to be disturbing. It is the recreation of the human, without the fleshy parts. Like the doll, the android is an amoral, immortal simulacra.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Japanese roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro unveiled Repliee Q1Expo, a female android. Repliee has silicone skin, motors that simulate breathing, and the ability to flutter its eyes. When demonstrating Repliee, Ishiguro found that although it was obvious that the android was just that, people interacting with her (if I may assign the machine a gender) unconsciously wanted to believe that she was real. &#8220;More importantly, we have found that people forget she is an android while interacting with her. Consciously, it is easy to see that she is an android, but unconsciously, we react to the android as if she were a woman&#8221; [Whitehouse 2005]. This reaction to the machine may be attributed to her appearance: she appears as real as the doll. Repliee represents innocence. Like the doll, she is the human form perfected, if degraded in her intelligence.</p>\n<p>The following year, Hiroshi Ishiguro unveiled his latest work: Geminoid HI-1. Created in his own image, Geminoid repeats the realism of Repliee, but this time integrating telepresence into the machine, so that Ishiguro can control and speak through the android remotely, creating a simulated intelligence [Hornyak 2006]. With this system, the human interactor need no longer slip into the unconscious to treat the android as if it was a man. The tele-present intelligence matches human intelligence, as does the mechanical body match in appearance the organic body, to make the bot completely believable in its form.</p>\n<p>Raised from the pages of science fiction possibilities, as an external, idealized entity with which we interact, Geminoid HI-1 functions as a perfected being. But the doll or android alone could never fulfill our lustful search for innocence. It is only a unidimensional projection of perfection, not perfection itself. Our surroundings, our reality, remains limited and flawed, &#8220;too small for human imagination&#8221; [Laurel 1992:87]. In the quest for innocence, we must turn to a full-scale modification of our reality. The android raises possibilities in this direction. It not only allows us to fulfill the common wish of the industrial capitalist to be in two places at once, but also promises a manifestation in physical form of our idealized avatar, not simply one stagnant, but one through which we can act, interact, and even live. It is a titillating hint of the possibility of full cyborgization. But before the avatar can be manifest as an objective form that we would consider real, it must first be explored and constructed elsewhere. It must be placed within a perfected environment. Virtual reality allows us this possibility.</p>\n<p>In the words of Brenda Laurel, virtual reality is a &#8220;manifestation of the age-old desire to make our fantasies palpable &#8212; our insatiable need to exercise our imagination, judgment, and spirit in world, situations, and personae that are different from our everyday lives&#8221; [Laurel 1992:87]. The earliest form of this is the moving picture, that &#8220;most beautiful fraud&#8221; [Wikipedia 2008]. Entering the darkened cinema, senses not required for the visual experience are themselves dimmed. We find ourselves immersed in the action on screen. Our emotions are tied to those mythic characters who appear human, save for in the way which would expel them from the virtual reality of the silver screen and link them with us; save for their achievement of innocence. The troubles of the characters end up solved, they do not bleed, perhaps they can even fly. Their world is clean, everything perfected for the action of the character. It is a constructed Eden. Preserved on celluloid or silicon, the forms are immortal. With computers, we are able to intimately control these characters. The level of realism is increased another mark.</p>\n<p>In the modern virtual environment (rendered or not), we act out our own wants and desires. A perfected avatar within a perfected environment. Death is preventable &#8212; we need only yell &#8220;Reset!&#8221; to boot ourselves out of peril [Oshii 2001] &#8212; but if it does occur, it is only a minor setback. We have powers and possibilities not available in the world of our daily experience. With enough time and effort, perhaps we ourselves can even become god-like, leveling up and reaching ever so much higher than ever before. Rather than only observing our perfected abstractions, such as with dolls, virtual reality allows action to take place through them, and it facilitates this within a constructed paradise.</p>\n<p>Accessing the Internet is an integral part of this quest for regaining innocence. Plugging ourselves in, our consciousness melds with the vast global network. The darkness of the desert of the real disappears to the blinding light of cyberspace.  Our bounded consciousness is unleashed in to the greater nodal network. We may harvest data from an immense library of both knowledge and experience. The internet brings us closer to god: it is nothing short of the Tower of Babel, allowing all humanity to interact and, in that interaction, reach a more perfected state. Here, in this city of flowing light, we are all immortal entities, able to shift our perfected forms into any shape we see fit.</p>\n<p>But the knowledge that this is a facade can never be lost. It ever looms over the experience, waiting to shock us rudely as we log out of the virtual world and enter the reality of everyday experience. We may plug ourselves in, but our consciousness remains aware that it is an experience bounded, with those borders separate from the borders of our daily reality. Enter hyperreality: a reality constructed with elements of the non-real. It is an augmented truth, which is in itself not a lie, but truth. Unlike virtual reality, fantasy is not bounded in the hyperreal. The reality fully stimulates the senses: the unconscious, and the conscious. With the ability to augment our reality without the need for a suspension of disbelief &#8212; without the notion of disbelief itself &#8212; we can climb to the very top of Nimrod&#8217;s tower. Hyperreality, smugly, promises godliness.</p>\n<p>Jean Baudrillard describes the hyperreal as &#8220;a real without origin or reality&#8221; [Baudrillard 1994:1]. He and other philosophers of the hyperreal draw on a short story penned by Jorge Luis Borges. In the story, the ruler of a vast empire causes a map of his territories to be drawn. It so detailed that the map was the very size of the empire. It covers the land, and becomes indistinguishable from the territory itself [Borges]. Baudrillard treats this fable as &#8220;the most beautiful allegory of simulation&#8221; [Baudrillard 1994:1], but in his analysis of the fable, Baudrillard claims that the difference between the map and the reality has disappeared. It is not that we mistake the map for the territory, but that there is no difference.</p>\n<p>Umberto Eco discusses the wax work museums of America as a simulacra demonstrative of a hyperreal experience. Here, &#8220;copies&#8221; of original paintings are presented, but fuller and more real than the original. They surpass and placate any desire to experience the original. These reproductions themselves become real. The lighting, music, and even the temperature of the room are all augmented to match the scene and provide a more full sensory experience. Imitations improving reality. The wax creations are simulacra: copies without originals [Eco 1990].</p>\n<p>The hyperreality not only manifests our ideals, but integrates them into our own experience such that they become indistinguishable from truth &#8212; indeed, such that they <em>become truth</em>. War by Hollywood and CNN. The American West sanitized, idealized, and regurgitated through John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. It promises a world which we can control completely &#8212; solipsism in action, for even if the real is objective and separate from the mind, it can be reprogrammed completely to the liking of the individual. &#8220;[Hyperreality] surpasses traditional and natural reality in brilliance, richness, and pliability&#8221; [Borgmann 1992:83].</p>\n<p>Heinz Pagel offers an explanation for the existence of the simulacra of reality: &#8220;A good simulation&#8230; gives us a sense of mastery over our experience. To represent something symbolically, as we do when we speak or write, is somehow to capture it, thus making it one&#8217;s own. But with this appropriation comes the realization that we have denied the immediacy of reality and that in creating a substitute we have but spun another thread into the web of our grand illusion&#8221; [Pagel 1989:88]. In that the simulation demonstrates mastery over the simulation, Pagel is correct. But he takes a dim view of this, relegating it to only &#8220;another thread&#8221; in a &#8220;grand illusion&#8221;. He misses, it seems, that this mastery may not be an illusion &#8212; or, rather, that the illusion ceases to be an illusion as it comes into existence. It is an altering of reality, not something fake, but as real as that which was altered.</p>\n<p>A critic of the post-human, N. Katherine Hayles claims that &#8220;hyperreality does not erase [the borders separating simulations from reality], for they exist whether we recognize them or not; it only erases them from our consciousness&#8221; [Hayles 1991]. Yet this seems only a description of virtual reality. Hyperreality is a stage further, also erasing the borders in our unconscious. It does not tread too close to solipsism, I think, to say that with both the conscious and unconscious blissfully unaware of the separation between simulation and reality, the distinction no longer exists. It is not ignoring the borders till they go away &#8212; we do not know what to ignore in the first place. Erased from the mind, they are erased from existence.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Cypher and Eric Higgs explore Disney&#8217;s Wilderness Lodge in Orlando as an extreme hyperreality. It is crafted as a perfected conglomerate of National Park lodges from the American Northwest. &#8220;The real thing only better, wilderness without dirt or danger.&#8221; Through its augmentation, this sanitized simulacra achieves dominance over the reality the lodge is modeled on &#8212; but it is a real thing itself. To those who stay in the lodge, but never glimpse that which it is modeled on, the Wilderness Lodge is an accurate representation of reality, an irony of contradictions [Haraway 1991:434]. The totem poles, &#8220;stone inlaid with designs suggesting Navajo and Hopi blanket patterns&#8221;, and &#8220;teepee-shaped light fixtures&#8221; are, like Disney&#8217;s Native Americans in Peter Pan, artifacts of a history that wasn&#8217;t quite, but through our story-telling, become real. And why shouldn&#8217;t they? To forget the American government&#8217;s perpetuation of genocide, to eliminate the mosquito from the forest: it is an agreeable rewriting of the truth. It makes our past, our present, and our future more bearable. As the authors write, &#8220;the lodge reproduces and represents something which does not exist&#8230; it is truly a copy without an original&#8221; [Cypher].</p>\n<p>As our environment is improved, so too our selves. The body and the mind both live vicariously, augmenting their state and form in relation to perceived reality. We seek to drown ourselves in the amniotic ocean of the womb.</p>\n<p>Mamoru Oshii explores hyperreality in his film <em>Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</em>. In the film&#8217;s world, metal has meshed with meat such that cyborgs represent normality, and the organic human &#8212; even one with a synthetic brain &#8212; is the exception. Japan&#8217;s culture, ever loving of its dolls, has progressed so that autonomous humanoid robots are common, filling functions both of work and pleasure. The film centers on a small law enforcement unit attempting to answer why a new model of androids have begun to self-destruct.  The world portrayed is a perfect hyperreality. The characters, as cyborgs, are ever jacked in to a seemingly infinite data network, allowing themselves to unbind their consciousness &#8212; or ghosts, as the film has it. The fleshy parts of the human body have been replaced, so that while they tend still to maintain the appearance of humanoid normalcy, body parts are synthetic and mechanical; under warranty, owned, and able to be replaced or upgraded. When online, the character&#8217;s vision of meatspace fuses seamlessly with the virtual world, negating the difference between the real and the virtual. Planes and submarines take on organic forms, with bird-like wings and fish-like fins [Oshii 2004]. It is a meshing of flesh and machine, an abomination.</p>\n<p>In this hyperreality, the android dolls, often indistinguishable from the cyborg human, disrupt order by self-destructing or, as one character (modeled on cyborg theorist Donna Haraway) puts it, committing suicide. At film&#8217;s end, the cyborg protagonist discovers that the android suicide is caused by the ghost in the shell. The doll manufacturer, seeking a cheaper and more believable alternative to artificial intelligence, had kidnapped children, copying their ghost into the cyber-brain of the dolls. As the ghost cannot exist in two places at once, this &#8220;ghost-dubbing&#8221; kills the child, effectively moving the child&#8217;s consciousness into the doll. The children were not terribly thrilled by their forced shift from animal to machine, and kill themselves to draw attention to their plight.</p>\n<p>The world of the film is, as the title suggests, an extreme representation of the technologically mediated quest for innocence. It shows us the doll become human, and the human become doll. Yet Oshii reveals that this quest for the abstraction of innocence both within the self and outside the self achieves only more flaws and imperfection.</p>\n<p>With the body augmented by cybernetics, our humanness replaced with the post-human, and our identification not as a biological organism, but as a cyborg, we turn ourselves into dolls. Prolonged life, replaceable limbs. As we connect our minds to the vastness of a global computer network, our bounded consciousness spreads, transcending our meager human grey-matter. This hyperreal, cybernetic simulacra, projected by Oshii&#8217;s film, is a convergence of the threads in our search for innocence. A melding of technologies and thought permeating the body and the environment [Laurel 2000]; information reprogrammed, augmenting our being, transcending our nature, reaching ever closer to the infinite mind of the universe.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Myth of the Eternal Return</em>, Mircea Eliade illustrates an ontology for &#8220;archaic man&#8221;. His analysis of primitive myth leads him to the conclusion that, in this archaic ontology, no action has meaning except in as much as it replicates the action of a mythic being &#8220;<em>in illo tempore</em>&#8220;. He cites this as an attempt to return to an animal state of innocence; a &#8220;nostalgia for the lost paradise&#8230; [A paradise] with the image of an ideal humanity enjoying beatitude and spiritual plenitude forever unrealizable in the present state of &#8216;fallen man&#8217;&#8230; [A] very distant epoch when men knew neither death nor toil nor suffering&#8221; [Eliada 2005:3].</p>\n<p>Eliade errs only in limiting his illustration to the Other. This yearning &#8212; this nostalgia &#8212; for innocence has not been limited to our ancestors or our primitive brethren. We are all creatures of myth. The quest is a phenomena that spans time and culture, weaving the whole of our species into a web of common human existence &#8212; a &#8220;desperate effort not to lose contact with <em>being</em>&#8221; [Eliada 2005:3-92].</p>\n<p>Yet with the possibilities offered by the technologies of today and tomorrow, the quest threatens to disconnect us from both our selves and our neighbors. The hyperreal, simulacra of an existence is no longer a way to live in the world, but a way to live outside of it. It is a product of a mythos that no longer resonates with our experience of being. Not until our experiences are justified by the sacred will we be satisfied with the profane. Rather than augmenting our experience, we must augment our myth. We need a new myth. A myth in which we are neither perfect nor fallen. A myth with the ability to live. Even within our literate culture &#8212; a culture which often shuns oral, living documents &#8212; we must dream a collective cosmology that can integrate itself into our existence and shift with the dynamic flowing of time.</p>\n<h3>Works Cited</h3>\n\n<p>Baudrillard, Jean.\n    1994 Simulacra and Simulation.

Slicehost has <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/10/25/creating-mx-records-for-google-apps">a guide to creating MX records for Google Apps</a>. I have a couple other domains with Google Apps, along with a couple domains hosted locally with addresses that simply forward to my primary, Google hosted, email. I also need to send mail from the server. To accomplish all of this, I use <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nInstalling Postfix is a simple matter. Telnet is used quite a bit for testing, so I install that too:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install postfix telnet mailutils\r\n\r\nThe Postfix setup will ask how it should be installed -- we want the "Internet Site" option -- and then ask you for your fully qualified domain name.\r\n\r\nDone? Let\'s make sure Postfix is running:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ telnet localhost 25\r\n\r\nIf it\'s working Postfix should return:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Trying 127.0.0.1...\r\n    Connected to localhost.\r\n    Escape character is \'^]\'.\r\n    220 localhost ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)\r\n\r\nLet\'s send a test message from root to the user account <code>user</code> (replace that with whatever your standard user is):\r\n\r\n    ehlo localhost\r\n    mail from: root@localhost\r\n    rcpt to: user@localhost\r\n    data\r\n    Subject: Test\r\n    Hi, is this thing on?\r\n    .\r\n    quit \r\n\r\nNow, check your email as `user` by running `mail`. See the message? Good.\r\n\r\nOpen `/etc/postfix/main.cf` to make sure that Postfix knows what domains it\'s receiving mail for. To do this, edit the `mydestination` variable to include all the proper domains. For me, the name of my server looks like server.mydomain.com. I want Postfix to accept mail for that domain, but not for mydomain.com (since that\'s being handled by Google Apps), so mine looks like:\r\n\r\n    mydestination = server.mydomain.com, localhost.mydomain.com , localhost\r\n\r\nRestart Postfix if you made any changes:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart\r\n\r\nRight. Now let\'s send another test. Notice this time we\'re using full domain names, instead of localhost:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ telnet server.mydomain.com 25\r\n\r\n    ehlo server.mydomain.com\r\n    mail from: root@server.mydomain.com\r\n    rcpt to: user@server.mydomain.com\r\n    data\r\n    Subject: domains!\r\n    woot... I think this works.\r\n    .\r\n    quit\r\n\r\nWorking? Good.\r\n\r\nLet\'s test from the outside. The first step is to open up the correct ports in the firewall. Assuming you have iptables configured in the way the <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/11/6/ubuntu-gutsy-setup-page-1">Slicehost article suggests</a>, open up your `/etc/iptables.test.rules` and add the following:\r\n\r\n    # Allow mail server connections\r\n    -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 25 -j ACCEPT \r\n\r\nNow let\'s apply the rules:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.test.rules\r\n\r\nMake sure everything looks dandy:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo iptables -L\r\n\r\nIf it meets your fancy, save the rules:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo -i\r\n    $ iptables-save > /etc/iptables.up.rules\r\n\r\nAnd now, from your local computer, let\'s test it out.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ telnet server.mydomain.com 25\r\n\r\n    ehlo server.mydomain.com\r\n    mail from: root@server.mydomain.com\r\n    rcpt to: user@server.mydomain.com\r\n    data\r\n    Subject: remote connection test\r\n    Hello, you.\r\n    .\r\n    quit\r\n\r\nNow check your mail on the mail server as before. Once again, everything should be working.\r\n\r\nNow we need to setup a virtual domain. Remember, I don\'t want any virtual users. I only want aliases at a virtual domain to forward to my primary email address. That makes this relatively simple. (Be very, very happy. You should have seen this guide before, when I was still hosting virtual domains with virtual users!) Open up `/etc/postfix/main.cf` and add the following:\r\n\r\n    virtual_alias_domains = myvirtualdomain.com\r\n    virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual\r\n\r\nCreate the `/etc/postfix/virtual` file referenced above and add the aliases:\r\n\r\n    alias@myvirtualdomain.com       user@mydomain.com\r\n\r\nTurn it into a database:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ cd /etc/postfix\r\n    $ sudo postmap virtual\r\n\r\nRestart Postfix:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart\r\n\r\nAttempt to send an email to the new alias at the virtual domain:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ telnet server.mydomain.com 25\r\n    ehlo server.mydomain.com\r\n    mail from: root@server.mydomain.com\r\n    rcpt to: alias@myvirtualdomain.com\r\n    data\r\n    Subject: virtual domain test\r\n    I hope this works!\r\n    .\r\n    quit\r\n\r\nThe message should now be in your primary email inbox!\r\n\r\nAs long as we\'re setting up forwards, let\'s forward system account mail to somewhere where it\'ll actually get read. To do so, create a `~/.forward` file with the following contents:\r\n\r\n    user@mydomain.com\r\n\r\nLet\'s also create a `/root/.forward`, so that roots mail gets forwarded to my local account (where it is then forwarded to my primary email). Root\'s forward would simply read:\r\n\r\n    user\r\n\r\nNext up: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-wordpress">install Wordpress with rewrites</a>.

Let&#8217;s make sure Postfix is running:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>telnet localhost 25\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s working Postfix should return:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Trying</span> <span class="mf">127.0.0.1</span><span class="o">...</span>\n<span class="n">Connected</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">localhost</span><span class="o">.</span>\n<span class="n">Escape</span> <span class="n">character</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="s">&#39;^]&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span>\n<span class="mi">220</span> <span class="n">localhost</span> <span class="n">ESMTP</span> <span class="n">Postfix</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Ubuntu</span><span class="p">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s send a test message from root to the user account <code>user</code> (replace that with whatever your standard user is):</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ehlo</span> <span class="n">localhost</span>\n<span class="n">mail</span> <span class="n">from:</span> <span class="n">root</span><span class="nv">@localhost</span>\n<span class="n">rcpt</span> <span class="n">to:</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="nv">@localhost</span>\n<span class="n">data</span>\n<span class="n">Subject:</span> <span class="n">Test</span>\n<span class="n">Hi</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">thing</span> <span class="n">on</span><span class="p">?</span>\n<span class="o">.</span>\n<span class="n">quit</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now, check your email as <code>user</code> by running <code>mail</code>. See the message? Good.</p>\n<p>Open <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code> to make sure that Postfix knows what domains it&#8217;s receiving mail for. To do this, edit the <code>mydestination</code> variable to include all the proper domains. For me, the name of my server looks like server.mydomain.com. I want Postfix to accept mail for that domain, but not for mydomain.com (since that&#8217;s being handled by Google Apps), so mine looks like:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mydestination</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mydomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">localhost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mydomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">localhost</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Restart Postfix if you made any changes:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Right. Now let&#8217;s send another test. Notice this time we&#8217;re using full domain names, instead of localhost:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>telnet server.mydomain.com 25\n\nehlo server.mydomain.com\nmail from: root@server.mydomain.com\nrcpt to: user@server.mydomain.com\ndata\nSubject: domains!\nwoot... I think this works.\n.\nquit\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Working? Good.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s test from the outside. The first step is to open up the correct ports in the firewall. Assuming you have iptables configured in the way the <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/11/6/ubuntu-gutsy-setup-page-1">Slicehost article suggests</a>, open up your <code>/etc/iptables.test.rules</code> and add the following:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># Allow mail server connections</span>\n<span class="o">-</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">INPUT</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="n">tcp</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">state</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">state</span> <span class="n">NEW</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">dport</span> <span class="mi">25</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">j</span> <span class="n">ACCEPT</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s apply the rules:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables.test.rules\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Make sure everything looks dandy:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo iptables -L\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If it meets your fancy, save the rules:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo -i\n<span class="nv">$ </span>iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.up.rules\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And now, from your local computer, let&#8217;s test it out.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>telnet server.mydomain.com 25\n\nehlo server.mydomain.com\nmail from: root@server.mydomain.com\nrcpt to: user@server.mydomain.com\ndata\nSubject: remote connection <span class="nb">test</span>\nHello, you.\n.\nquit\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now check your mail on the mail server as before. Once again, everything should be working.</p>\n<p>Now we need to setup a virtual domain. Remember, I don&#8217;t want any virtual users. I only want aliases at a virtual domain to forward to my primary email address. That makes this relatively simple. (Be very, very happy. You should have seen this guide before, when I was still hosting virtual domains with virtual users!) Open up <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code> and add the following:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">virtual_alias_domains</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">myvirtualdomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>\n<span class="n">virtual_alias_maps</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hash:</span><span class="sr">/etc/</span><span class="n">postfix</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">virtual</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Create the <code>/etc/postfix/virtual</code> file referenced above and add the aliases:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">alias</span><span class="nv">@myvirtualdomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>       <span class="n">user</span><span class="nv">@mydomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Turn it into a database:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> /etc/postfix\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo postmap virtual\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Restart Postfix:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Attempt to send an email to the new alias at the virtual domain:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>telnet server.mydomain.com 25\nehlo server.mydomain.com\nmail from: root@server.mydomain.com\nrcpt to: <span class="nb">alias</span>@myvirtualdomain.com\ndata\nSubject: virtual domain <span class="nb">test</span>\nI hope this works!\n.\nquit\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The message should now be in your primary email inbox!</p>\n<p>As long as we&#8217;re setting up forwards, let&#8217;s forward system account mail to somewhere where it&#8217;ll actually get read. To do so, create a <code>~/.forward</code> file with the following contents:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">user</span><span class="nv">@mydomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s also create a <code>/root/.forward</code>, so that roots mail gets forwarded to my local account (where it is then forwarded to my primary email). Root&#8217;s forward would simply read:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">user</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Next up: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-wordpress">install Wordpress with rewrites</a>.

Let\'s do something with it.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a> is a small, lightweight web server that\'s all the rage on some small corners of the Net. <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> is extremely overkill for a small personal web server like this and, since we\'re limited to 256MB of RAM on this VPS, it quickly becomes a resource hog. <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a> is another small, lightweight web server, but I\'m a fan of Nginx. Try it out.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to install the web server. Nginx is now in Ubuntu\'s repositories:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install nginx\r\n\r\nThat\'s all it takes in Hardy, but if you really want a guide for it, <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/13/ubuntu-hardy-installing-nginx-via-aptitude">Slicehost has you covered</a>.\r\n\r\nSlicehost has a few more useful guides to Nginx, including introductions to the config layout and how to get started with vhosts:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/15/ubuntu-hardy-nginx-configuration">Nginx configuration</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/16/ubuntu-hardy-nginx-virtual-hosts">Nginx Virtual Hosts</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/16/ubuntu-hardy-nginx-virtual-host-settings">Nginx virtual host settings</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nNext up, we\'ll need to install MySQL and PHP, and get them working with Nginx.\r\n\r\nSlicehost has a guide for <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/11/23/ubuntu-gutsy-mysql-and-ror">installing MySQL and Ruby on Rails</a>, which also includes suggestions on optimizing MySQL. I follow the MySQL part of the guide, stopping at "Ruby on Rails install".\r\n\r\nNow MySQL is working, lets install PHP:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install php5-common php5-cgi php5-mysql php5-cli\r\n\r\nTo get PHP as FastCGI working with Nginx, we first have to spawn the fcgi process. There are a few different ways to do that. Personally, I use the <code>spawn-fcgi</code> app from <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>. To use it, we\'ll compile and make lighttpd, but <strong>not</strong> install it. We\'re only after one binary.\r\n\r\nLighttpd has a few extra requirements, so let\'s install those:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install libpcre3-dev libbz2-dev \r\n\r\nNow, download the source and compile lighttpd. Then copy the <code>spawn-fcgi</code> binary to <code>/usr/bin/</code>:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ wget http://www.lighttpd.net/download/lighttpd-1.4.19.tar.gz\r\n    $ tar xvzf lighttpd-1.4.19.tar.gz\r\n    $ cd lighttpd-1.4.19\r\n    $ ./configure\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ sudo cp src/spawn-fcgi /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi\r\n\r\nThen, create a script to launch spawn-fci (I call it <code>/usr/bin/php5-fastcgi</code>):\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/sh\r\n    /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u www-data -C 2 -f /usr/bin/php5-cgi\r\n\r\nThe script tells spawn-fcgi to launch a fastcgi process, listening on 127.0.01:9000, owned by the web user, with only 2 child processes. You may want more child processes, but I\'ve found 2 to be optimal.\r\n\r\nGive the script permissions:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/php5-fastcgi\r\n\r\nI then link the script filename to a version-neutral, err, version:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/php5-fastcgi /usr/bin/php-fastcgi\r\n\r\nNow we need an init script to start the process at boot. I use <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/nginx_php5_fast_cgi_xcache_ubuntu7.04">this one from HowToForge</a>, named <code>/etc/init.d/fastcgi</code>:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    PHP_SCRIPT=/usr/bin/php-fastcgi\r\n    RETVAL=0\r\n    case "$1" in\r\n        start)\r\n            echo "Starting fastcgi"\r\n            $PHP_SCRIPT\r\n            RETVAL=$?\r\n        ;;\r\n\tstop)\r\n            echo "Stopping fastcgi"\r\n            killall -9 php5-cgi\r\n            RETVAL=$?\r\n        ;;\r\n\trestart)\r\n            echo "Restarting fastcgi"\r\n            killall -9 php5-cgi\r\n            $PHP_SCRIPT\r\n            RETVAL=$?\r\n        ;;\r\n        *)\r\n            echo "Usage: php-fastcgi {start|stop|restart}"\r\n            exit 1\r\n        ;;\r\n    esac      \r\n    exit $RETVAL\r\n\r\nGive it permissions:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/fastcgi\r\n\r\nStart it:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/fastcgi start\r\n\r\nHave it start at boot:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo update-rc.d fastcgi defaults\r\n\r\nAlright, now that PHP is running how we want it to, let\'s tell Nginx to talk to it. To do that, add the following to your vhost server block in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com`, making sure to change the `SCRIPT_FILENAME` variable to match your directory structure:\r\n\r\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\r\n        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;\r\n        fastcgi_index  index.php;\r\n        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /home/user/public_html/mydomain.com/public$fastcgi_script_name;\r\n        include        /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow let\'s create that `/etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf` file that\'s being included above. As per the <a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxFcgiExample">Nginx wiki article</a>, mine looks like this:\r\n\r\n    fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;\r\n    fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx;\r\n    fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;\r\n    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;\r\n    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;\r\n    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;\r\n    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;\r\n    fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;\r\n    fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;\r\n    fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;\r\n    fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;\r\n    fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;\r\n    fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;\r\n    fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;\r\n    fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;\r\n\r\nThen restart Nginx:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart\r\n\r\nLet\'s create a file named `test.php` in your domain\'s public root to see if everything is working. Inside, do something like printing <a href="http://us2.php.net/phpinfo">phpinfo</a>.\r\n\r\nGo to http://mydomain.com/test.php. See it? Good. If you get "no input file specified" or somesuch, you broke something.\r\n\r\nIf you create an index.php, and delete any index.html or index.htm you might have, you\'ll notice Nginx throws a 403 Forbidden error. To fix that, find the line in your vhost config (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com`) under the `location /` block that reads `index index.html;` and change it to `index index.php index.html;`. Then restart Nginx.\r\n\r\nIf you want SSL with your Nginx, Slicehost has <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/12/19/ubuntu-gutsy-self-signed-ssl-certificates-and-nginx">a guide for generating the certificate</a> and <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/12/19/ubuntu-gutsy-nginx-ssl-and-vhosts">another guide for installing it</a>.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll want to install OpenSSL first:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install openssl\r\n\r\nThere is one bug in the second guide. In the first server module listening on port 443, which forwards www.domain1.com to domain1.com, the rewrite rule specifies the http protocol. So, in effect, what that rule does is forward you from a secure domain to unsecure: https://www.domain1.com to http://domain1.com. We want it to forward to a secure domain. Simply change the rewrite rule like thus:\r\n\r\n    rewrite ^/(.*) https://domain1.com permanent;\r\n\r\nNext up: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-mail">install a mail server</a>.

Nginx is now in Ubuntu&#8217;s repositories:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo aptitude install nginx\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all it takes in Hardy, but if you really want a guide for it, <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/13/ubuntu-hardy-installing-nginx-via-aptitude">Slicehost has you covered</a>.</p>\n<p>Slicehost has a few more useful guides to Nginx, including introductions to the config layout and how to get started with vhosts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/15/ubuntu-hardy-nginx-configuration">Nginx configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/16/ubuntu-hardy-nginx-virtual-hosts">Nginx Virtual Hosts</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/5/16/ubuntu-hardy-nginx-virtual-host-settings">Nginx virtual host settings</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Next up, we&#8217;ll need to install MySQL and PHP, and get them working with Nginx.</p>\n<p>Slicehost has a guide for <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/11/23/ubuntu-gutsy-mysql-and-ror">installing MySQL and Ruby on Rails</a>, which also includes suggestions on optimizing MySQL. I follow the MySQL part of the guide, stopping at &#8220;Ruby on Rails install&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Now MySQL is working, lets install PHP:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo aptitude install php5-common php5-cgi php5-mysql php5-cli\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>To get PHP as FastCGI working with Nginx, we first have to spawn the fcgi process. There are a few different ways to do that. Personally, I use the <code>spawn-fcgi</code> app from <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>. To use it, we&#8217;ll compile and make lighttpd, but <strong>not</strong> install it. We&#8217;re only after one binary.</p>\n<p>Lighttpd has a few extra requirements, so let&#8217;s install those:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo aptitude install libpcre3-dev libbz2-dev\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now, download the source and compile lighttpd. Then copy the <code>spawn-fcgi</code> binary to <code>/usr/bin/</code>:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>wget http://www.lighttpd.net/download/lighttpd-1.4.19.tar.gz\n<span class="nv">$ </span>tar xvzf lighttpd-1.4.19.tar.gz\n<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>lighttpd-1.4.19\n<span class="nv">$ </span>./configure\n<span class="nv">$ </span>make\n<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo cp src/spawn-fcgi /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Then, create a script to launch spawn-fci (I call it <code>/usr/bin/php5-fastcgi</code>):</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="sr">/usr/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="sr">/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u www-data -C 2 -f /</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="sr">/bin/</span><span class="n">php5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cgi</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The script tells spawn-fcgi to launch a fastcgi process, listening on 127.0.01:9000, owned by the web user, with only 2 child processes. You may want more child processes, but I&#8217;ve found 2 to be optimal.</p>\n<p>Give the script permissions:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/php5-fastcgi\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>I then link the script filename to a version-neutral, err, version:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/php5-fastcgi /usr/bin/php-fastcgi\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now we need an init script to start the process at boot. I use <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/nginx_php5_fast_cgi_xcache_ubuntu7.04">this one from HowToForge</a>, named <code>/etc/init.d/fastcgi</code>:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">PHP_SCRIPT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sr">/usr/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">php</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">fastcgi</span>\n<span class="n">RETVAL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>\n<span class="k">case</span> <span class="s">&quot;$1&quot;</span> <span class="n">in</span>\n    <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">)</span>\n        <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s">&quot;Starting fastcgi&quot;</span>\n        <span class="nv">$PHP_SCRIPT</span>\n        <span class="n">RETVAL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="vg">$?</span>\n    <span class="p">;;</span>\n<span class="n">stop</span><span class="p">)</span>\n        <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s">&quot;Stopping fastcgi&quot;</span>\n        <span class="n">killall</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">9</span> <span class="n">php5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cgi</span>\n        <span class="n">RETVAL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="vg">$?</span>\n    <span class="p">;;</span>\n<span class="n">restart</span><span class="p">)</span>\n        <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s">&quot;Restarting fastcgi&quot;</span>\n        <span class="n">killall</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">9</span> <span class="n">php5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cgi</span>\n        <span class="nv">$PHP_SCRIPT</span>\n        <span class="n">RETVAL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="vg">$?</span>\n    <span class="p">;;</span>\n    <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>\n        <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s">&quot;Usage: php-fastcgi {start|stop|restart}&quot;</span>\n        <span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="mi">1</span>\n    <span class="p">;;</span>\n<span class="n">esac</span>      \n<span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="nv">$RETVAL</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Give it permissions:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/fastcgi\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Start it:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo /etc/init.d/fastcgi start\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Have it start at boot:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo update-rc.d fastcgi defaults\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Alright, now that PHP is running how we want it to, let&#8217;s tell Nginx to talk to it. To do that, add the following to your vhost server block in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com</code>, making sure to change the <code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> variable to match your directory structure:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">~</span> <span class="o">\\.</span><span class="n">php</span><span class="nv">$</span> <span class="p">{</span>\n    <span class="n">fastcgi_pass</span>   <span class="mf">127.0.0.1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">9000</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">fastcgi_index</span>  <span class="nb">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">php</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">fastcgi_param</span>  <span class="n">SCRIPT_FILENAME</span>  <span class="sr">/home/</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="sr">/public_html/m</span><span class="n">ydomain</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">public</span><span class="nv">$fastcgi_script_name</span><span class="p">;</span>\n    <span class="n">include</span>        <span class="sr">/etc/</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">fastcgi</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span><span class="p">;</span>\n<span class="p">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s create that <code>/etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf</code> file that&#8217;s being included above.

Inside, do something like printing <a href="http://us2.php.net/phpinfo">phpinfo</a>.</p>\n<p>Go to http://mydomain.com/test.php. See it? Good. If you get &#8220;no input file specified&#8221; or somesuch, you broke something.</p>\n<p>If you create an index.php, and delete any index.html or index.htm you might have, you&#8217;ll notice Nginx throws a 403 Forbidden error. To fix that, find the line in your vhost config (<code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com</code>) under the <code>location /</code> block that reads <code>index index.html;</code> and change it to <code>index index.php index.html;</code>. Then restart Nginx.</p>\n<p>If you want SSL with your Nginx, Slicehost has <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/12/19/ubuntu-gutsy-self-signed-ssl-certificates-and-nginx">a guide for generating the certificate</a> and <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/12/19/ubuntu-gutsy-nginx-ssl-and-vhosts">another guide for installing it</a>.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to install OpenSSL first:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo aptitude install openssl\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>There is one bug in the second guide. In the first server module listening on port 443, which forwards www.domain1.com to domain1.com, the rewrite rule specifies the http protocol. So, in effect, what that rule does is forward you from a secure domain to unsecure: https://www.domain1.com to http://domain1.com. We want it to forward to a secure domain. Simply change the rewrite rule like thus:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">rewrite</span> <span class="o">^</span><span class="sr">/(.*) https:/</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">domain1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="n">permanent</span><span class="p">;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Next up: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-mail">install a mail server</a>.

After building a fresh Slice, you should first follow <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/4/25/ubuntu-hardy-setup-page-1">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/4/25/ubuntu-hardy-setup-page-2">Part 2</a> of Slicehost\'s basic setup articles.\r\n\r\nI use slightly different coloring in my bash prompt, so, rather than what Slicehost suggests in their article, I add the following to `~/.bashrc`:\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    export PS1=\'\\[\\033[0;32m\\]\\u@\\[\\033[0;35m\\]\\h\\[\\033[0;33m\\] \\w\\[\\033[00m\\]: \'\r\n\r\nThis is a good time to protect SSH by installing <a href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">DenyHosts</a>, which I discuss <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/10/03/thoughts-on-ssh-security/">here</a>:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install denyhosts\r\n\r\nUbuntu\'s default text editor is nano, which I abhor. Real men use vim. Ubuntu comes with a slimmed down version of vim, but you\'ll probably want the full version:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install vim\r\n\r\n\r\nTo change the global default editor variable, execute the following and select the editor of your choice:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo update-alternatives --config editor\r\n\r\nThis is also a perfect time to install <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a>.\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo aptitude install screen\r\n\r\nIf you\'re not familiar with Screen, <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/09/27/a-guide-to-gnu-screen/">Red Hat Magazine has a nice little introduction</a>\r\n\r\nMy .screenrc looks like this:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    # Print a pretty line at the bottom of the screen\r\n    hardstatus alwayslastline\r\n    hardstatus string \'%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{Y}%Y-%m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]\'\r\n    \r\n    # Nobody likes startup messages\r\n    startup_message off\r\n    \r\n    # Turn visual bell on and set the message to display for only a fraction of a second\r\n    vbell on\r\n    vbellwait .3\r\n    \r\n    # Set default shell title to blank\r\n    shelltitle \'\'\r\n    \r\n    # Gimme my scrollback!\r\n    defscrollback 5000\r\n    \r\n    # Change command character to backtick\r\n    escape `` \r\n    \r\n    # Stop programs (like vim) from leaving their contents\r\n    # in the window after they exit\r\n    altscreen on\r\n    \r\n    # Default screens\r\n    screen -t shell 0 \r\n\r\nI prefer to have my bash profile setup to connect me to Screen as soon as I login. If there are no running sessions, it will create one. If there is a current session, it will disconnect the session from wherever it is connected and connect it to my login. When I disconnect from screen, it automatically logs me out. To achieve this, I add the following to `~/.bashrc`:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    # If possible, reattach to an existing session and detach that session\r\n    # elsewhere. If not possible, create a new session.\r\n    if [ -z "$STY" ]; then\r\n        exec screen -dR\r\n    fi\r\n\r\nI would also recommend following Slicehost\'s guide to <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9/10/scanning-for-rootkits-with-chkrootkit">installing chkrootkit</a> and <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9/10/scanning-for-rootkits-with-rkhunter">rkhunter</a>.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: let\'s set the timezone of the server to whatever is local to you (Slicehost\'s Ubuntu image defaults to UTC). To do that, run:\r\n\r\n    #!bash\r\n    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\r\n\r\nNext up: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-web-server">install a web server</a>.'

Real men use vim. Ubuntu comes with a slimmed down version of vim, but you&#8217;ll probably want the full version:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo aptitude install vim\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>To change the global default editor variable, execute the following and select the editor of your choice:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo update-alternatives --config editor\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This is also a perfect time to install <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a>.</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo aptitude install screen\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Screen, <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/09/27/a-guide-to-gnu-screen/">Red Hat Magazine has a nice little introduction</a></p>\n<p>My .screenrc looks like this:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Print a pretty line at the bottom of the screen</span>\nhardstatus alwayslastline\nhardstatus string <span class="s1">&#39;%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{Y}%Y-%m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]&#39;</span>\n\n<span class="c"># Nobody likes startup messages</span>\nstartup_message off\n\n<span class="c"># Turn visual bell on and set the message to display for only a fraction of a second</span>\nvbell on\nvbellwait .3\n\n<span class="c"># Set default shell title to blank</span>\nshelltitle <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>\n\n<span class="c"># Gimme my scrollback!</span>\ndefscrollback 5000\n\n<span class="c"># Change command character to backtick</span>\nescape <span class="sb">``</span>\n\n<span class="c"># Stop programs (like vim) from leaving their contents</span>\n<span class="c"># in the window after they exit</span>\naltscreen on\n\n<span class="c"># Default screens</span>\nscreen -t shell 0\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>I prefer to have my bash profile setup to connect me to Screen as soon as I login. If there are no running sessions, it will create one. If there is a current session, it will disconnect the session from wherever it is connected and connect it to my login. When I disconnect from screen, it automatically logs me out. To achieve this, I add the following to <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># If possible, reattach to an existing session and detach that session</span>\n<span class="c"># elsewhere. If not possible, create a new session.</span>\n<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -z <span class="s2">&quot;$STY&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>\n<span class="k">    </span><span class="nb">exec </span>screen -dR\n<span class="k">fi</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>I would also recommend following Slicehost&#8217;s guide to <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9/10/scanning-for-rootkits-with-chkrootkit">installing chkrootkit</a> and <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9/10/scanning-for-rootkits-with-rkhunter">rkhunter</a>.</p>\n<p>One more thing: let&#8217;s set the timezone of the server to whatever is local to you (Slicehost&#8217;s Ubuntu image defaults to UTC). To do that, run:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Next up: <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2008/06/10/an-ubuntu-vps-on-slicehost-web-server">install a web server</a>.</p>'

    vellum_post_167.body = u'Last March, I used part of my REI dividend on a pair of <a href="http://www.yoursole.com/products/footbeds/signature/viesturs/">Sole Ed Viesturs Ultra Cushion footbeds</a>. Prior to this, I\'d been using <a href="http://www.superfeet.com/products/Green.aspx">Green Superfeet</a> in my <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2008/02/02/lowa-renegade-mid-hiking-boots/">Lowa Renegade boots</a>.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhen I pulled the Green Superfeet out of my boots and attempted to install the new Sole footbeds to insure I had a proper fit, they were quite hard to insert -- much harder than the Superfeet. I took them out and compared them with the Superfeet to see if they wanted trimming, but they appeared only a millimeter or so longer. They were, though, much thicker than the Superfeet -- particular in the arch area -- which was what, I deduced, made the fit a bit more tight.\n\nSo, I tried inserting them again, this time shoving them almost all the way in, then put in my feet to force the footbeds into place. I felt around a good deal to assure myself that there was no bunching at the toe, then took them out again and popped them in the oven.\n\nSole includes a sticker on the bottom of one of the pair that turns from silver to black when properly heated. They claim that 2 minutes in a 200F oven should do it, but that, if not, give \'em 5 minutes, then assume the sticker is defective and stick the footbeds into your boots anyway. Well, it actually took 6 minutes in my oven at 200F. After the sticker had turned black, I stuck the footbeds into my boots, laced them up, and stood up straight, feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed forward, for two minutes. The warmth was actually quite pleasant, particularly on a cold, wet day.\n\n<h2>An aside on Superfeet:</h2>\nI purchased my first pair of Green Superfeet last summer while working for the National Park Service. My footwear at the time was a pair of Merrell Sawtooth boots -- easily the stiffest, most uncomfortable boot I\'ve ever worn. Any more than 6-7 miles in those and my feet would start to develop an ache. And going over ridges: that was absolutely no fun. The boots were completely lacking in support during downhill endeavors -- which, to be fair, was not entirely the boots\' fault. My arches aren\'t completely collapsed, but I do have flat feet, which, as you may know, equals zero shock absorption. So when I traversed my way down a rocky slope in the Sawtooths, I felt it. Shortly after purchasing the boots, but long enough after that I felt I had broken them in as much as I could, I went out and bought the Green Superfeet. The difference was stark. Really quite amazing. They were hard and awkward for about the first week, but after that break-in period, the Superfeet turned the Merrell Sawtooths into completely acceptable boots. I could log far more miles, over any terrain, with any slope, all without ache. They were great. When I left the park, I bought a second pair of Superfeet, this time for my 5.11 HRT boots, in the hopes that I could breathe a little more life into them. Alas, it was for naught. Even with the Superfeet, I had to admit to myself that the 5.11s were at the end of their life.\n\nWhile I would certainly call the Superfeet supportive, I\'m not sure I\'d term them comfortable. And in fact, Superfeet claims that the insoles should not be comfortable. If it felt like one was walking on a soft mattress, the insoles wouldn\'t be giving the feet any support. I don\'t know much about feet, but the argument makes sense to me. Personally, while moving with the Superfeet, I had no complaints, but standing still for more than a few minutes, they would start to become noticable uncomfortable. Not painful, but uncomfortable. The discomfort originated in the arch area of the footbed, which I felt was too high for me. A bit like if I had a small ping pong ball or somesuch under my arch. Again, I don\'t know much about feet, but this made complete sense to me. My feet are flat, thus I have very little shock absorption. The Superfeet provide shock absorption, thus they must be pushing up my arch. So I couldn\'t, and still can\'t, complain.\n\nWhile I\'m here, I\'d like to make a comment on Superfeet sizing. My boot size is a US 9.5. Superfeet classifies their insoles by letters. Their size E equates to shoe sizes US 9.5-11. I\'ve used size E Superfeet in three different pairs of boots (all size 9.5), and it\'s always been a perfect fit. No trimming necessary. Great for me, but if you happen to be size US 11, I\'d be a little weary. Definitely buy them from a store with a decent return policy, as you may find yourself wanting to upgrade to size F.\n\nBut when I heard about Sole, who made footbeds that actually molded themselves to the wearers feet, and that wearers often termed them as not only supportive, but <em>comfortable</em>, I was intrigued. I thought perhaps they could reach a pleasant medium between pressing up the arch for support, but not pressing it up <em>too</em> much.\n\n<h2>Back to Sole:</h2>\n\nAfter the initial 2 minute molding process, I walked around them a short while. An immediate, very stark difference from the Superfeet was evident. The Soles were, in fact, <em>comfortable</em>. The level of comfort worried me, actually. I feared they wouldn\'t give me any support what-so-ever.\n\nI have by now logged enough mileage, over enough terrain, under enough of a load to over a verdict: thumbs up. The comfort, compared to the Superfeet, allows me to to travel slightly greater mileages in the same boots than before.\n\nI still keep the Green Superfeet in my running shoes, but I, personally, find the Sole footbeds superior.

    vellum_post_167.body_rendered = u'<p>Last March, I used part of my REI dividend on a pair of <a href="http://www.yoursole.com/products/footbeds/signature/viesturs/">Sole Ed Viesturs Ultra Cushion footbeds</a>. Prior to this, I&#8217;d been using <a href="http://www.superfeet.com/products/Green.aspx">Green Superfeet</a> in my <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2008/02/02/lowa-renegade-mid-hiking-boots/">Lowa Renegade boots</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>When I pulled the Green Superfeet out of my boots and attempted to install the new Sole footbeds to insure I had a proper fit, they were quite hard to insert &#8212; much harder than the Superfeet. I took them out and compared them with the Superfeet to see if they wanted trimming, but they appeared only a millimeter or so longer. They were, though, much thicker than the Superfeet &#8212; particular in the arch area &#8212; which was what, I deduced, made the fit a bit more tight.</p>\n<p>So, I tried inserting them again, this time shoving them almost all the way in, then put in my feet to force the footbeds into place. I felt around a good deal to assure myself that there was no bunching at the toe, then took them out again and popped them in the oven.</p>\n<p>Sole includes a sticker on the bottom of one of the pair that turns from silver to black when properly heated. They claim that 2 minutes in a 200F oven should do it, but that, if not, give &#8216;em 5 minutes, then assume the sticker is defective and stick the footbeds into your boots anyway. Well, it actually took 6 minutes in my oven at 200F. After the sticker had turned black, I stuck the footbeds into my boots, laced them up, and stood up straight, feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed forward, for two minutes. The warmth was actually quite pleasant, particularly on a cold, wet day.</p>\n<h2>An aside on Superfeet:</h2>\n\n<p>I purchased my first pair of Green Superfeet last summer while working for the National Park Service. My footwear at the time was a pair of Merrell Sawtooth boots &#8212; easily the stiffest, most uncomfortable boot I&#8217;ve ever worn. Any more than 6-7 miles in those and my feet would start to develop an ache. And going over ridges: that was absolutely no fun. The boots were completely lacking in support during downhill endeavors &#8212; which, to be fair, was not entirely the boots&#8217; fault. My arches aren&#8217;t completely collapsed, but I do have flat feet, which, as you may know, equals zero shock absorption. So when I traversed my way down a rocky slope in the Sawtooths, I felt it. Shortly after purchasing the boots, but long enough after that I felt I had broken them in as much as I could, I went out and bought the Green Superfeet. The difference was stark. Really quite amazing. They were hard and awkward for about the first week, but after that break-in period, the Superfeet turned the Merrell Sawtooths into completely acceptable boots. I could log far more miles, over any terrain, with any slope, all without ache. They were great. When I left the park, I bought a second pair of Superfeet, this time for my 5.11 HRT boots, in the hopes that I could breathe a little more life into them. Alas, it was for naught. Even with the Superfeet, I had to admit to myself that the 5.11s were at the end of their life.</p>\n<p>While I would certainly call the Superfeet supportive, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d term them comfortable. And in fact, Superfeet claims that the insoles should not be comfortable. If it felt like one was walking on a soft mattress, the insoles wouldn&#8217;t be giving the feet any support. I don&#8217;t know much about feet, but the argument makes sense to me. Personally, while moving with the Superfeet, I had no complaints, but standing still for more than a few minutes, they would start to become noticable uncomfortable. Not painful, but uncomfortable. The discomfort originated in the arch area of the footbed, which I felt was too high for me. A bit like if I had a small ping pong ball or somesuch under my arch. Again, I don&#8217;t know much about feet, but this made complete sense to me. My feet are flat, thus I have very little shock absorption. The Superfeet provide shock absorption, thus they must be pushing up my arch. So I couldn&#8217;t, and still can&#8217;t, complain.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to make a comment on Superfeet sizing. My boot size is a US 9.5. Superfeet classifies their insoles by letters. Their size E equates to shoe sizes US 9.5-11. I&#8217;ve used size E Superfeet in three different pairs of boots (all size 9.5), and it&#8217;s always been a perfect fit. No trimming necessary. Great for me, but if you happen to be size US 11, I&#8217;d be a little weary. Definitely buy them from a store with a decent return policy, as you may find yourself wanting to upgrade to size F.</p>\n<p>But when I heard about Sole, who made footbeds that actually molded themselves to the wearers feet, and that wearers often termed them as not only supportive, but <em>comfortable</em>, I was intrigued. I thought perhaps they could reach a pleasant medium between pressing up the arch for support, but not pressing it up <em>too</em> much.</p>\n<h2>Back to Sole:</h2>\n\n<p>After the initial 2 minute molding process, I walked around them a short while. An immediate, very stark difference from the Superfeet was evident. The Soles were, in fact, <em>comfortable</em>. The level of comfort worried me, actually. I feared they wouldn&#8217;t give me any support what-so-ever.</p>\n<p>I have by now logged enough mileage, over enough terrain, under enough of a load to over a verdict: thumbs up. The comfort, compared to the Superfeet, allows me to to travel slightly greater mileages in the same boots than before.</p>\n<p>I still keep the Green Superfeet in my running shoes, but I, personally, find the Sole footbeds superior. I would caution that feet are extremely variable, and the merits of both Superfeet and Sole are strong, but, it would seem, complimentary to different foot types. Experiment!</p>\n<p>There is absolutely <strong>no reason</strong> not to purchase a pair of non-standard insoles for your footwear &#8212; even with good boots. The thin, non-supportive, flimsy things that manufacturers include standard cannot match a custom pair.

I did this after a shower every day, but after 3 days the foot had begun to look worse. So, I performed further research: what athlete\'s foot was, how it grew, and possible remedies. This led to me devising the following schedule (note that I shower in the evenings):\n\n<ul>\n<li>Morning:\n   <ul>\n      <li>Upon waking, rub the foot with rubbing alcohol (70% isopropyl), which is both cleansing and drying.</li>\n      <li>Before leaving for the day, rub the foot with Tea Tree Oil, an anti-septic.</li>\n   </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Afternoon:\n   <ul>\n      <li>Soak in a garlic bath for 30 minutes, then towel dry.</li>\n   </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Evening:\n  <ul>\n      <li>After shower, powder the foot with Baking Soda.</li>\n      <li>Before bed, rub the foot with Tea Tree Oil.</li>\n   </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nObserving this schedule, the infection cleared up in 5 days.\n\nLuckily, the temperatures have been rising lately, so I was also able to stop wearing socks whenever home. This gives my feet ample time to dry after the shower, and all night to breathe.\n\nThe garlic bath is made by crushing 4 garlic cloves and placing them in a large pot of warm water, with a splash of rubbing alcohol added.

Usually I wash it by hand with a bit of Bronner\'s Magic Soap in the sink, then let it hang dry in the sun. At the end of last summer, the leather band surrounding the hat was entirely covered in salt crystallized from my sweat, so I tossed it into the washing machine with the rest of my load. It survived, faded but not damaged. Throughout all this wear and washing, the oil finish has thinned and is gone in some places, so the water resiliency is lessened.\n\nI will probably have to replace it before the year is out.

They\'re a local brand and have a reputation for quality. <a href="http://www.tilley.com/">Tilley Endurables</a>\'s reputation is unsurpassed by other hatters for quality and durability, but they\'re a bit pricey and none of their models have the classic style of the packer hat.\n\nOne word of warning for any considering the style: random people tell me at least every other week that I look like Indiana Jones (or, if they\'re more intoxicated, "hey, you look that guy with the whip!") -- this despite the fact that Indiana Jones\' hat is clearly a fedora, and my hat clearly is not. With the new film coming out, I imagine these occurrences will only increase.\n\n<blockquote>Tramps like to lie down on their sides a lot.

You\'re a lucky tramp if you have a hat, that\'s good shade, but if you don\'t have a hat you\'re gonna have a sunburn and not just your face and your arms but your eyeballs, your eyeballs will get beet-red because lots of times there just ain\'t anywhere to go to get out of the sun. A tramp ain\'t gonna have a cigarette or a drink when he wants one and he don\'t think about getting old, he just thinks about getting by, and if a drink of bourbon replaces a drink of water and he\'s in the desert, well then he needed that bourbon more than the water, but he\'ll take the water with him, case the bourbon dries up.

    vellum_post_179.body = u'For the past month, I\'ve been observing a sort of water diet.\n\nAn Iranian fellow, by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fereydoon_Batmanghelidj">Dr. Batmanghelidj</a> (or, as most refer to him, Dr. Batman), was of the belief that a deficiency of water in the body can be cited as the cause to near all illnesses and afflictions. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Batmanghelidj">search of his name</a> turns up numerous criticisms of the method, but I thought I\'d try it. It\'s clear that dehydration can contribute to, if not cause, many ailments, and it\'s no leap of faith to call our society chronically dehydrated, what with all the shit we shovel down our throats.\n\nI\'ve yet to read Dr. Batman\'s book, but built my schedule from the <a href="http://zenchillcom.blogspot.com/2006/07/allergy-cure.html">ZehChill blog</a>, which claims the regiment consists of drinking half one\'s body weight in ounces per day, along with 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt per 32 ounces water, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. Now, as I mentioned above, Dr. Batman was Iranian. He was also trained in Scotland and practiced in England. So, it would follow that if he tells us to measure our drink based on body weight, he would be referring to body weight in kilograms, no? Well, the aforementioned blog uses pounds, and, as an American, it\'s expected of me to be stubborn and not recognize that the French invented a superior system. So, I\'m sticking with pounds.\n\nLuckily, I\'m a small guy, so the required amount of water is not difficult to consume. I already avoid alcohol, and the only caffeine I take is the occasional bit from green tea, which I don\'t drink terribly often. Pretty much anything I cook involves obscene amounts of sea salt, making hyponatremia not much of a concern, though I\'ve upped the amount, regardless.\n\nMy regiment has been to drink 16oz of water with 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt second thing upon waking (first thing is a piss), doing the same in the evening (including the pissing), and fill the rest in during the day (I piss a lot here, too). Actually, I usually end up going a bit over half my body weight (though I probably piss twice that amount out).\n\nThe most noticeable result of all this, in case you haven\'t gathered, is that I have to piss like a man just cut for the stone every few hours -- and it\'s always clear, or bordering on it. Which is actually quite satisfying (both the pissing and seeing how clear it is). But, there have been a few results beyond that.\n\nI first started this thing on a Saturday. The Thursday previous I had come down with what could have been an exceptionally bad cold, but felt to me like influenza (I don\'t get vaccinated). By Monday, I was fine. Whether it was a cold or the flu, I\'m impressed.\n\nI feel I have more energy throughout the day since starting. I also began playing with my diet (solids) at about the same time, though, so I can\'t contribute the energy solely to water.\n\nMy skin, particularly my hands, have the habit of becoming extremely dry and cracked (occasionally painful) during the winter. This ceased a couple weeks into the water diet. My knuckles are still a little cracked (driving my barehanded fists into focus mits probably isn\'t helping in that regard), but nothing near like what they usually are.\n\nAll in all, I see no reason not to continue. It is quite clearly not producing any negative effects, and possibly producing positive ones. I\'d be curious to hear any other experiences.'

New insoles bought me a little while longer, but the fact had to be faced.\r\n\r\nI knew exactly what boots I wanted to replace them. Trouble was, I couldn\'t afford them. (Still can\'t, in fact.)

So I took (perhaps unfair) advantage of REI\'s lenient return policy, and ended up with a pair of Lowa Renegades for only $30.\r\n\r\nThe craftsmanship is excellent. I can spot no failures of any kind along the boots. Most any other boot I\'ve worn for this amount of time has shown some small failure: a broken stitch, or a bit coming unglued somewhere. Not so with the Renegades. The Germans, I think, know a thing a two about making boots. (Actually, they\'re made in Slovakia, but I\'m Am\'r\'can, damnit, so that\'s close enough for me.)\r\n\r\nThe soles are Vibram, like most other boots, and provide excellent traction on varied terrain: concrete, dirt, rocks, etc. Snow is a little iffy, but that\'s been the case with any boot I\'ve had.\r\n\r\nThe Gore-Tex liner is great. Verifiably waterproof and breathable (though I\'ve not had the opportunity to wear the boots in hot weather).\r\n\r\nThe break-in period was non-existent. They were comfortable and supportive as soon as I put them on.\r\n\r\nMy feet registered no complaints concerning the standard Lowa insoles, but they were small and flimsy, like those provided by any other boot manufacturer, and I\'ve been in a love affair with <a href="http://www.superfeet.com/store/Green.aspx">Green Superfeet</a> since the Summer (more on that later), so after a couple weeks I swapped them out, and have been happier for it.\r\n\r\nSome people report Lowa runs slightly large, but I found this to be untrue. I ordered my normal boot size, and they fit perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe absolutely only complaint I can offer for the Renegades is the lacing system. Lowa is quite fond of their D-rings. I am not. They allow for slightly faster unlacing, but slower lacing. And if you lace too fast, without paying attention, the lace may not make it\'s way entirely inside one of the rings, and pop out eventually. This happens every now and then to me. It\'s not enough to turn me off from the boots, or dissuade me from recommending them, but it is a minor annoyance.

Though this Fall and Winter, regrettably, have seen me mostly in urban areas, not logging any serious mileage over mountainous terrain with heavy loads, I am very pleased with the Renegades and whole-heartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a mid-to-light hiking boot, or footwear for every day urban wear.

After it seems to be fully soaked, remove the brush from the water and turn it parallel to the stream, so that the bristles are pointed down. Allow excess moisture to drip out, taking care not to flick or otherwise encourage any additional water to drip than the brush is willing to give on its own.</li>\r\n<li>Now that the brush is only dripping the occasional, non-continuous drop, move it to your soap dish/mug. Gently move the brush about atop the soap, in a circular motion, applying little pressure and taking care to not circle too vigorously and flick off any additional moisture. The objective here is not to generate a lather on the soap, but to gather soap in the brush\'s hairs. If a lather does begin to develop within the dish, the brush has enough soap. I circle for about 30 seconds.</li>\r\n<li>Bring the brush to your face and begin to circle in a wide motion around the area to be shaved. Apply only gentle pressure. Here, you are attempting to build up a lather, but patience is required: it may take up to 2 minutes for a sufficient lather to develop. (It usually takes me about a minute). After the lather has achieved the desired covering and consistency, place the brush into the soap dish.</li>\r\n<li>Now, bring the razor to your face. The objective is to run the razor down the lather-covered area (from top to bottom, or north to south), applying <strong>no</strong> pressure, whilst maintaining a 30&#176; angle to the skin. I prefer long strokes along the face, but resort to short strokes around the contours of the neck and chin. To start, it is easiest to place the razor\'s safety bar perpendicular to the skin and raise it slowly till the desired 30&#176; angle is achieved. Then, begin the stroke.</li>\r\n<li>The first pass having now been completed, it is likely that a second is wanting. A second lathering may be required, though I omit this step. On this second pass, the stroke should be from bottom to top, or south to north.</li>\r\n<li>With these two passes complete, any remaining patches of stubble may be removed with a diagonal stroke</li>\r\n<li>The shave now being complete, I finish up with a splash of cold water on the face, which, I\'m told, closes the pores (and provides opportunity to remove any excess soap), and pat my face dry.</li>\r\n<li>As an aftershave, I only splash my face with a bit of Witch Hazel in liquid form.</li>\r\n<li>For the clean up, the badger hair brush should be thoroughly rinsed and dried. The razor gets a rinse, though a complete disassembly is only required once a week when the blade is changed.</li>\r\n</ol>'

    vellum_post_184.body = u'The Wednesday before last I managed to fracture a rib at Fight Club. It failed to make itself known during class -- only later did I inventory a small, sharp pain upon taking deep breathes. My journal that night accounts:\n\n<blockquote>1-2-08 10:12 PM\nIt hurts when I breath.\nIs that bad?</blockquote>\n\nThinking nothing of it, I returned to class on Thursday, which proved to be a mistake, the pain after that night being far greater. At this point, I decided that something was not quite right. My next journal entry reads:\n\n<blockquote>1-4-08 8:10 PM\nMy self-diagnosis is that I have a fractured rib. It is either the 2nd or 3rd rib (or both) down from the top on my right side. I don\'t think it anything serious: my breathing is even, at a normal cycle and depth, and (as near as I can tell) there are no abnormal sounds. This leads me to believe that it is a minor fracture, not a break, and that the lung has not been punctured by a stray splinter.\n\nDeep breaths are painful, but not so much as to discourage them. Certain obtuse movements of the right arm, as well as twisting of the torso, causes pain. The most painful act is bending over to tie my boots -- methinks it is gravity dropping all my guts and exerting pressure onto the rib. I now kneel instead. I have yet to cough.\n</blockquote>\n\nConsulting the medical books I have lying about (and the global interwebs), the only treatment for such an ailment proved to be observing a minimum of one deep breath an hour and a strict rest cure, to last till the rib was healed, which on average takes 2-3 weeks. Clearly, this would not do. A month absent from Fight Club would be regrettable, but a month without running or riding my bike or any other activity that involves frequent deep breaths would not be possible (though the pain was not enough to discourage my normal cycle and depth of breathing, what was previously aerobic had become anaerobic and what was anaerobic was right out). As such, I decided to alter my diet in an attempt to assist the healing process.\n\n<h3>Calcium & Silica</h3>\nOf course, it is common knowledge that bones need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium">Calcium</a> to grow. I dislike milk, but instead increased my intake of almonds, broccoli, carrots and salmon; all of which are rich sources of the mineral. For teas, I purchased Horsetail and Nettle, to supplement the Alfalfa and Chamomile which I already had. Horsetail and Nettle, it just so happens, are also a source of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica">Silica</a>, which, I\'ve read, aids in the proper assimilation of Calcium.\n\n<h3>Magnesium & Vitamin D</h3>\nBut, surely, Calcium is not all that is required? Further research indicated that both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium">Magnesium</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D">Vitamin D</a> intake should be increased when consuming more Calcium. And what herbs provide an ample source of both Magnesium and Vitamin D? Why, Alfalfa, Horsetail, and Nettle, of course! It\'s almost as if Mother Nature <em>knows what she\'s doing</em>. Food sources of Vitamin D include egg yolk, salmon, and sweet potatoes. Food sources of Magnesium may be seafood, apples, bananas, brown rice, and salmon.\n\n<h3>Phosphorous & Copper</h3>\nCare should be taken to increase the amount present of two other minerals, as well: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus">Phosphorous</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper">Copper</a>. Eggs and salmon, it turns out, are excellent sources of Phosphorous. Copper may be acquired through almonds. (Side note: I\'ve discerned that it is not possible to kill oneself by eating too many sprouted almonds. If it were, I surely would be dead by now.)\n\n<h3>Results</h3>\n\nSo my diet changed to consist of much salmon, brown rice, carrots, apples, bananas, broccoli, with the odd sweet potato and a hard boiled egg once a day. Whenever I felt the need to munch on something, I\'d toss down a handful of sprouted almonds (as I\'m doing right now). Each morning I would have a cup of Nettle tea, each night a cup of Horsetail tea. If I felt the desire for tea in the middle of the day, I would mix together a bit of Chamomile with a bit of Alfalfa.\n\nAll said and done, the rib healed in a week and a half.\n\nDid my diet influence that? Well, diet couldn\'t <em>not</em> influenced the body, but as this is the first time I\'ve fractured a rib, I\'ve no bench-line against which I can measure; save only that the Medical Establishment deemed 2-3 weeks an appropriate number to publish here and there. It certainly didn\'t hurt.\n\n(Food and herbal sources of vitamins and minerals were all gathered from the CedarLily Vitamin & Mineral chart that <a href="http://www.learningherbs.com/herbal_remedy_wall_charts.html">John Gallagher used to sell</a>.)'

My preferred rant was <em>My Machine, My Comrade</em> by a one Prof. Calamity, in which he sees steampunk as "seeking[ing] to liberate the machine from simply existing as an instrument of work, while at the same time not elevating mechanical forms above all else... Steampunk seeks to find a relationship with the world of gears, steel, and steam that allows machines to not only co-inhabit our world but to be partners in our journey." My favorite fiction was Margaret P. Killjoy\'s <em>Yena of Angeline in "Sandstorms by Gaslight"</em> which (very much like mine own fiction) seems to go nowhere. It has no direction, and does not leave its reader with a sense of anything being accomplished, which makes it a disappointing first read.

I purchased it partly to support SteamPunk Magazine, but mostly for Colin Foran\'s artwork, which provides a wonderful backdrop to the gritty subject of post-Civilization apocalyptic survival. Beyond comparisons to other manuals for outliving Civilization, my main criticism is that of the style of writing. Writers in the Victorian era were much more liberal than us in their use of capitalization, but there was a system. When I read those works, I feel the capitalization adds a certain emotion to the writing. Being a SteamPunk\'s Guide, the author of this work (by happenstance, the same Margaret Killjoy whom I praised above) attempted to duplicate this capitalization, but failed. Whether there was or was not a system, it feels arbitrary, and detracts from the overall work. The Guide does present an attempt to emulate that era\'s vocabulary, and I think does a good job of that -- combining a sense of Victorian grace with modern punk and a bit of wit, for an agreeable solution of steampunk.'

I haven\'t been able to find any USB wifi dongles that please me, so I decided to go another route.\n\nThe <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</a> project is alternative firmware that turns your <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices" >supported consumer wireless AP</a> into an untamed beast. More to the point, it allows the AP to act as a repeater -- hijacking a current signal, boosting it, and rebroadcasting. For the hardware, I bartered for a Linksys WRT54GL (v1.1) at the Bay of E. The device is supported, and has two <a href="http://wireless.gumph.org/content/3/7/011-cable-connectors.html" >RP-TNC jacks</a>, allowing me to replace the default antennas with two of my uncommonly large spikes.\n\nDespite the labyrinth of convoluted, contradictory information that is the <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" >DD-WRT wiki</a>, installation was quite simple. First, I reset the router to factory defaults through the web interface. It was new out of the box, so I imagine already set to factory defaults, but who knows. The wiki suggests the first flash of the WRT54GL be with the mini firmware, but, after that, it can be flashed to <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_DD-WRT%3F#File_Versions" >any other version</a>. So, I downloaded both dd-wrt.v23_sp2_mini.zip and dd-wrt.v23_sp2_standard.zip. The wiki also claims that Firefox may fubar the upgrade and suggests using IE in its stead. Not having access to IE, I went to flash dd-wrt.v23_mini_generic.bin through the web interface using Safari, which promptly failed. The router\'s default firmware was in no way damaged, so I went to do the same thing again in Firefox (2.0.0.11), which worked without a hitch. Giving no explanation as to why, the wiki suggests that after one arrives at the "Upgrade Successful" screen, one should wait for the esoteric count of 5 minutes before hitting continue (perhaps while chanting some manner of incantation). I did this (minus the chanting), hit continue, and was greeted by a login prompt. The default user/pass of root/admin didn\'t work, so I held down the reset switch on the back of the router for 30 seconds (leaving the power cord plugged in), after which the router booted up, accepted the root/admin login, and all was shiny. After that, I upgraded to the standard firmware without note, and quickly realized that I actually needed the v24 beta firmware. So, I grabbed dd-wrt.v24_std_generic.bin, upgraded to that (again without problem), and was finally ready to turn it into <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wlan_Repeater" >a repeater</a>.\n\nTo set it up, I first changed the router\'s IP to 192.168.69.1, so that it was on a different subnet than my target. Next, under Wireless Basic Settings, I changed the mode to Repeater, entered the target SSID, and changed the wireless channel to Auto, leaving all the other settings on their defaults. After saving those settings, I added a virtual interface with my own SSID and made sure it was set to Bridged. Then, after saving that, I followed the wiki\'s advice to go to the Security tab, uncheck everything under Block WAN Requests and disabled the firewall. That was it. The router had a WAN IP displayed in the upper right hand corner, indicating that it was working.\n\nNote that up till here, I was doing everything on the router through a wired connection, which was strongly urged in many places and seemed wise to me. At this point, I unplugged the cat5, turned on my Airport, connected to my new AP, and was online immediately.'

After that, I upgraded to the standard firmware without note, and quickly realized that I actually needed the v24 beta firmware. So, I grabbed dd-wrt.v24_std_generic.bin, upgraded to that (again without problem), and was finally ready to turn it into <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wlan_Repeater">a repeater</a>.</p>\n<p>To set it up, I first changed the router&#8217;s IP to 192.168.69.1, so that it was on a different subnet than my target. Next, under Wireless Basic Settings, I changed the mode to Repeater, entered the target SSID, and changed the wireless channel to Auto, leaving all the other settings on their defaults. After saving those settings, I added a virtual interface with my own SSID and made sure it was set to Bridged. Then, after saving that, I followed the wiki&#8217;s advice to go to the Security tab, uncheck everything under Block WAN Requests and disabled the firewall. That was it. The router had a WAN IP displayed in the upper right hand corner, indicating that it was working.</p>\n<p>Note that up till here, I was doing everything on the router through a wired connection, which was strongly urged in many places and seemed wise to me. At this point, I unplugged the cat5, turned on my Airport, connected to my new AP, and was online immediately.</p>'

    vellum_post_208.body = u'You\'d think that after however many thousands of years, pants would have stopped evolving. How much can you do with a pair of pants? Apparently, if you\'re Triple Aught Design, just a little bit more.\n\n<a href="http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Apparel/Pants-And-Shorts">TAD Gear\'s Force 10 Legionnaire Classic Cargo Pants</a> are an amazing pair of pants. I mean it. Really. There\'s pants, and then there\'s TAD pants. With a really big gap in between the two. And the TAD pants are on the upper end. Way up.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1974052241/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/1974052241_6fa4683323.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt="TAD Gear Legionnaire Cargos" /></a>\n\nThe Legionnaires are made from 7.5 oz cotton "gabardine" -- which is just a fancy way of saying twill (I had to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabardine">look that up</a>). (They\'re also available in ripstop.) They have two front pockets, two rear pockets, two cargo pockets, and two thigh pockets.\n\nThe cargo pockets aren\'t just normal cargo pockets -- they\'re 9" deep behemoths (that\'s a Hebrew word for beast, by the way). They\'re great. You could probably loose something in their abyss, but they\'re somehow non-intrusive.\n\nThe two front pockets aren\'t just normal pockets, either. They both sport clip reinforcements. That\'s right: both sides. And they aren\'t just little reinforcements on the seams, like on 5.11 pants. They\'re diamonds that reinforce the whole shebang and provide a more secure hold for your pocket knife, thanks to the thicker fabric. The right front pocket also has an interior coin pocket. (Note: I\'ve found that these pockets do not work with Emerson Knives\' wave opener.) I should also mention that the pockets are made of the same tough material as the rest of the pants -- a welcome feature, to be sure. The first failures I always experience on pants are holes in the cheap material used to make pockets.\n\nThe back pockets are just normal back pockets. (You thought I was going to say they weren\'t, didn\'t you? Well, they do have the very stylish button-and-ribbon closures that are also found on the cargo pockets.) \n\nThe front of the pants have two D-rings, one on each side. Again, beating 5.11 pants by one. I really don\'t know why more folks don\'t put these on their pants.\n\nEvery single stress point on these pants are bartacked. All of them. There\'s not a single point where reinforcements are missing. The butt is reinforced, the knees are reinforced and slightly articulated, every seam is reinforced.\n\nThe absolute best thing about these pants are the two front thigh pockets. It\'s honestly hard for me to put on a pair of pants without these now. They\'re a perfect fit for seemingly everything I want to put in them -- cell phone, gps, camera, energy bar, notepad.\n\nAnother amazing feature -- and one that makes me love TAD even more -- is that the only logo on the pants (excluding the "TAD Gear green label" on the inside of the fly) is <em>velcroed</em> on to the right cargo pocket. Velcroed. TAD is actually giving the wearer the option of advertising for them. What other company does that? Everyone else plasters their logos all over their products and forces me to go to the trouble of cutting them off or covering them up. (TAD, Kifaru, and Arc\'Teryx are usually the only companies I billboard for.)\n\nLast June I used the uniform grant I had been given to buy a pair of TAD\'s <a href="http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Apparel/Pants-And-Shorts">Force 10 Combat Pants</a> (seen <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1973081648/in/set-72157603096287137/">here</a> on patrol) and I actually like the Legionnaires better. The Force 10\'s triple reinforced knees added a good deal of heat in the sun and I didn\'t find them necessary for my needs. I liked the top slot of the cargo pockets, but I found that the internal dividers would sometimes annoy me as I\'d blindly reach into the pockets, groping for something, and put my hand into one of the smaller pockets instead of the main bellow. The ribbons on the cargo pocket buttons weren\'t sewn down (as they are on these newer Legionnaires) and often got in the way. The one feature I really wish they\'d carry over to the Legionnaires is the diamond gusseted crotch.\n\nIn case you haven\'t caught on, the Legionnares are amazing pants. They\'re expensive, but worth the money. Go hungry for a few days if you have to. I\'ve worn these pants every day since I bought them last month, and if I had the money I\'d purchase a second pair.\n\n(MilitaryMorons, of course, has a <a href="http://www.militarymorons.com/gear/garments.1.html#classic">better review</a>, though his are a slightly older style. These new ones have a zipper fly instead of buttons and all pocket ribbons are now sewn down.)\n\nSome people have been curious about my rolls. I started rolling my pants last year at <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/08/13/mutate-or-die/">MutantFest</a>. I got too lazy to blouse them every day, but wanted to keep them out of the water and mud. After that, it stuck. I started riding a bike, and the rolling kept the right pant leg from getting messed up the chain. It isn\'t dependent on wearing combat boots -- I can do it with shorter hikers. I\'ve since discovered that rock climbers roll their pants. I like to think that copying them makes other folk less excited than bloused pants with combat boots. But most of all, I keep doing it because I can refer to my rolled pants as "combat knickers", which is a source of great amusement.'

There\'s nothing to scream "shoot me first", but one can rest assured that some measure of toughness was put into its construction, and some thought into its design.\n\nThere are two breast pockets, roughly 5.5" x 5", which close with two velcro squares. Behind the breast pocket on either side are one of the shirt\'s best features: hidden document pockets. These open vertically in the "Napoleon style" with two velcro rectangles and measure in at about 6.5" x 10". They\'re great for carrying tickets, notebooks, passports (yes, plural; you know you have more than one, you double agent you), or, if you\'re one of the 5.11 models, a small firearm.\n\nThe shirt also features a vented back (one of the few areas where the observant onlooker may notice something odd about the shirt) with mesh lining, rolled-up-sleeve-holder-thingies, and two small underarm vents (read: holes) for warmer weather.\n\nThe left sleeve sports two pen slots near the top, one of which I can just squeeze a kubotan into, though it\'s a little awkward.\n\nThe shirt\'s elbows are reinforced and, best of all, almost every seam is triple stitched. I don\'t know why practices like that aren\'t more common on clothing.\n\nAdditionally, 5.11 includes two epaulets and a badge holder to be optionally sewn on the shirt.\n\nTwo logos are placed on the shirt, in addition to the neck tag: one on the bottom and one on the left cuff, both of which can be easily cut off for sanitation.\n\nI\'ve only had this black cotton shirt now for a few weeks, but have no complaints so far. It\'s a well made piece of clothing that blends right in at most locations (or would blend in, had I not sewn the jolly roger on the right sleeve), but I\'m not afraid to roll around in the dirt in. A perfect example of a dual use garment.\n\nThe ripstop nylon version of the shirt I\'ve had since last March and have been extremely pleased. It\'s slid down more than a couple cliffs and has stayed together and presentable through situations where other synthetic shirts from REI, Mountain Hardwear, and Cabelas have not. I\'ve worn it comfortably up to 100F (or at least as comfortable as I was in that temperature with just a t-shirt) and often will wear it in colder temperatures over a fleece or merino mid-layer to protect those undergarments from ripping.\n\n<a href="http://www.lapolicegear.com/" >LAPoliceGear</a> was kind enough to send me this shirt for review. They maintain a large stock of 5.11 products for fast shipping, all at some of the best prices on the net.

Nothing new, little debatable, and not to be shocking to all but the most naive. I kept asking myself "And what is your point?"\n\nThe film begins Part II with an audio excerpt defining myth as an "orienting and mobilizing story for a people." Correct. "The focus is not on the story\'s relation to reality, but on it\'s function." Incorrect. The myth\'s focus is entirely on its relation to reality and thus its function: its function is to explain reality. "A story cannot function unless it is believed to be true in the community or the nation." Incorrect. Useful, but incorrect. In fact, the film itself disproves this. In it\'s beginning, it covers a number of the stories of Christianity and their metaphorical, astrological significance, which is no revelation. I think -- I hope -- very few Christians actually believe in the literal resurrection (or even the literal existence) of their dead-guy-on-a-stick, but that does nothing to lessen or alter that story\'s function.\n\nFrom this faulty basis they break into footage of the collapse of the World Trade Center and begin to question the official stories of the events, attempting to draw a parallel, it would seem, between this and religion.\n\nPart III discusses the financial control of our government -- the grip of the central banks -- and ends with their plans of one world government.\n\nThere is a disconnect between the film\'s beginning, discussing religion, and the later parts. Only at the end are the lines attempted to be drawn. They mean to show religion as a control structure and more importantly a lie, similar to events such as 9/11. But not enough parallels are drawn, and the idea is fundamentally flawed. Where religious belief structures are created out of a desire for good and then twisted for evil, events and stories such as 9/11 were never intended for any good. Most importantly, where the stories of 9/11 are a lie, myth -- religion -- is a metaphor. Not a lie.\n\nI would have removed the first part and made into a separate film.\n\nAs Yet-Another-9/11-Film and a documentary on financial control, Zeitgeist sits on par with the rest. As something greater, it fails.\n\n(But it does include excerpts from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/">Network</a>, which makes it worth viewing.)\n\n<a href="http://vavrek.com/index.html" >Vavrek</a> has uploaded a 3GB DVD rip of the film to my anonymous ftp.

Always in my pack is a <a href="http://store.silvacompass.com/products/345156/Ranger_CL__515_Compass">Silva Ranger CL</a> compass -- a light, compact compass, for which I can use to navigate either with the terrain or with a map. The compass is stored in a <a href="http://www.tripleaughtdesign.com/Equipment/Pouches/BC8-Pouch">TAD Gear BC-8</a> pouch, which I picked up on my pilgrimage to <span class="removed_link">TAD</span> while passing through San Francisco earlier this summer. The pouch can be attached to my belt, pack, or any other piece of webbing, assuring the compass always has a place on my person, without taking up precious pocket space.\n\nIn the field, I also carry a <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=145&pID=326" >Garmin Etrex Vista Cx</a> GPS device. The GPS is unessential and shouldn\'t be relied upon for primary navigation. Its error is larger than that of a compass; it depends upon a clear line of sight to the sky, making it more of a hassle than a help to use in forested areas; and, of course, it depends upon batteries. I\'ve had one occasion this summer where the GPS insisted that North was South and South was North, implying either a sporadic pole shift or shaky satellite reception. My primary use of the GPS is the trip computer -- the odometor, my moving time, my stopping time, my average speed, and elevation shift. I\'ll also use it for a quick reading of my coordinates to get a rough idea where I am, and occasionally the Tracks program, which can be used to retrace my steps.\n\nAlways carry a map. USGS 7.5" topo maps are the best. On my backcountry trips here in the Park, I carry a minimum of 3 maps: a Tom Harrison Map of the entire Park, a Tom Harrison Map more specific to my location in the Park, and the USGS maps for each quadrangle I plan to walk through. The map I primary reference is the second Tom Harrison, which is clear and easy to read and has mileage printed directly on the trails. The USGS maps I carry for cross-country travel or in case I get lost. The large Tom Harrison map is carried more for a sense of place and planning other trips.\n\nLearn to read a map. I\'ve never had a class in the subject, nor read a book, but I\'m confident in my ability to utilize a map. The best way to learn is practice. Here\'s what to do: buy the USGS 7.5" quadrangle for the area you live in. If you live in an urban area, try to buy a quadrangle for a nearby park or forested area -- someplace that isn\'t flattened and paved. (But buy the maps for the urban areas too! I have the 7" quadrangles for the city I live in, covering my home and commute, taped on my wall, for exploration and post-Apocalypse survival.) Now take your new map and wander into the woods. Figure out where you are. Find a feature on the map, such as a hill or a ridge, and then find it in your place. How steep are the contours in real life? Here\'s a hint: contours "V" upstream.\n\nEven if you\'re unable to triangulate your position or perform other minute calculations, you should have the confidence to read a map and have a rough idea of what that means in real life. A few weeks ago, a visitor came in to the Visitor Center in the Park while I was working. He was interested in a backcountry permit. After glancing at the map, he asked how much water he should bring. I hate giving someone like that a permit. If you\'re unable to read the steepness of the trail and the locations of water sources, you have no business in the backcountry. And everybody <em>should</em> have business in the backcountry. So learn to read.\n\nPictures of my gear may be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157603095200992/" >found here</a>.'

It sits at 11,188 feet -- just a little below <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/07/13/alta-peak/">Alta</a>. On this last 3 day trip in the backcounty, I took a day to attempt it. From my camp at <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/07/19/ranger-lake/">Ranger Lake</a>, there\'s a trail that took me about 2 miles and 1,000 feet to the top of Silliman Pass. From there, I cut south to go cross-country 2 miles and 1,000 feet to the summit.\n\nAbout half the trek is a scramble up and down granite boulders. I had a couple questionable moments, where I wasn\'t sure if I could get back, or even forward, and had to elect for a risky slide on my backside. The other half opens up into wider, flatter stretches of sand. There I saw Mountain Lion tracks and, for the first time, the tracks of the ever-elusive Bighorn Sheep.\n\nAfter about 1.5 miles cross-country, I decided to turn around, having made it almost to the base of the summit. I hadn\'t started till late in the day so I was losing the sun, and the terrain ahead looked like it was to get a bit technical for my non-existent rock climbing skills. (My hands were already scraped up and blistered from the scrambling and the previous day\'s adventures.)\n\nThe views from the crest rivaled that of Alta; I was able to hang my feet over the jagged, immense cliff on the eastern side while stopping for a snack. The attempt was not wasted.

The Powers-That-Be don\'t like me driving the marked cruisers around, though I transported one through the park a week or so ago. The reason they give me is not that I may misrepresent a federal agent, take advantage of the lights or sirens, or speed off with a few thousand dollars worth of government property -- none of those logical reasons. What they tell me is that the stripes are provocative, and I may be shot at. Personally, I think the unmarked vehicles are more provocative, what with their GSA plates, antennas, and hidden lights barely visible through the windshield. It has that sort of undercover I\'m-stalking-you look to it. But, I\'m glad to have use of the car, instead of burning my own gas or relying on rides from the other Rangers. (Not to mention, everyone pulls over and lets you pass when they notice the plates.)\n\nToday, I drove myself down to the Lodgepole area, with intention of taking a jaunt down to Alta Meadow: a respectable 5.7 mile (one way) hike, with 2,000 feet elevation gain. At the junction where the trail splits, the right heading to the meadow and the left to Alta Peak, I decided it was still early enough to give a try for the peak -- despite the protestations of my trail map ("very strenuous...don\'t undertake this trail unless you are in good physical condition...one of the most strenuous trails in the western half of Sequoia National Park.") From the junction, the peak is only about 2 miles away, but in those two miles awaits 2,000 feet of rocky elevation gain.\n\nI did make it to the 11,204 feet summit and the views (this being my first time in the high Sierra) were stunning, despite the haze of pollution from the West.\n\nFor your enjoyment are some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157603096287137/">pictures and videos</a> taken along the way (any chattering in the background of the videos is my radio).'
    vellum_post_240.body_rendered = u'<p>One of the sub-district rangers is out of town this week, so I have use of her unmarked car. The Powers-That-Be don&#8217;t like me driving the marked cruisers around, though I transported one through the park a week or so ago. The reason they give me is not that I may misrepresent a federal agent, take advantage of the lights or sirens, or speed off with a few thousand dollars worth of government property &#8212; none of those logical reasons. What they tell me is that the stripes are provocative, and I may be shot at. Personally, I think the unmarked vehicles are more provocative, what with their GSA plates, antennas, and hidden lights barely visible through the windshield. It has that sort of undercover I&#8217;m-stalking-you look to it. But, I&#8217;m glad to have use of the car, instead of burning my own gas or relying on rides from the other Rangers. (Not to mention, everyone pulls over and lets you pass when they notice the plates.)</p>\n<p>Today, I drove myself down to the Lodgepole area, with intention of taking a jaunt down to Alta Meadow: a respectable 5.7 mile (one way) hike, with 2,000 feet elevation gain.

The ability to get up and leave with the changing of the season. It represents diversity; dependence not on a handful of crops, but on an eclectic plethora of subsistence.\n\nFor thousands of years the nomad has been the bane of the farmer -- the farmer who is immobile, tied to his place. Who is dependent on his technological mastery of the land and his homogeneous crop. The Chinese built and rebuilt the Great Wall to seperate themselves from the nomadic pastoralists of the Steppes.\n\nThe Middle East, once a great, thriving civilization of farmers, was leveled by the nomad Chinggis Khan.

I\'m leaning toward this one. It\'s closer, so I\'d have more time, and the ferries are cheap for walk-ons.

And it is, of course, still a worthy read today. It is the only book I\'ve read on the subject that discusses no modern implements. Not once is more than an acknowledgment offered to, for example, a steel knife. All of the skills described in the book are meant to be performed with absolutely nothing but what is found in Wilderness. It covers more than what Elpel discusses in <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/02/13/participating-in-nature/">Participating in Nature</a>, but doesn\'t go as in depth. Though the author, in the beginning, shows he has skills as a story teller, the book is written more as a manual. It\'s use of diagrams and pictures are also lacking.

And it is, of course, still a worthy read today. It is the only book I&#8217;ve read on the subject that discusses no modern implements. Not once is more than an acknowledgment offered to, for example, a steel knife. All of the skills described in the book are meant to be performed with absolutely nothing but what is found in Wilderness. It covers more than what Elpel discusses in <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/02/13/participating-in-nature/">Participating in Nature</a>, but doesn&#8217;t go as in depth. Though the author, in the beginning, shows he has skills as a story teller, the book is written more as a manual. It&#8217;s use of diagrams and pictures are also lacking. But, Olsen&#8217;s creations are often more elegant than those in Elpel&#8217;s book.

As you can see, there\'s a multitude of different topics covered every day, plus a fair amount of nightly reading. Short (30-60 min) scenarios are interspersed between lectures. There were a little under 30 students and two different teachers, both W-EMT, who would alternate between lecture topics. The lectures themselves are in a relaxed format. In addition to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wilderness-First-Responder-2nd-Recognition/dp/0762728019/sr=8-1/qid=1168287357/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1468798-3387320?ie=UTF8&s=books" >textbook</a>, students are provided with a workbook, referred to as the hymnal. The hymnal summarizes all the topics and provides the notes you\'d normally be jotting down during lecture. There are two big scenarios throughout the course, the MCI and Night Rescue.\n\nThe Mass Casualty Incident, or MCI, is a 2 hours (or so) scenario designed to give students the experience of managing multiple patients with limited resources. I was a patient for this one, and unconscious for about half of it, but the main emphasis seemed to be on managing rescuer stress and deciding evac orders. (There was only one helicopter, so only one pt could be evaced at a time.)\n\nThe Night Rescue mission is definitely the high-light of the course. Sadly, we all took an oath of secrecy, so as not to rob future WFR-ers of the experience. I can relate to you the weather, though: temperatures hovered above freezing, with snow forecast, but instead a downpour of rain and wind gusts of 30-40mph. I\'ll also say that I\'m now completely justified in packing my <a href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=728" >silponcho</a> and <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/01/06/note-to-self-2/">wearing paracord bracelets</a>.\n\nOverall impression of the course is two thumbs up. I\'d do it all over again. In fact, I\'m disappointed that the re-cert class I\'ll be taking in two years is only 3 days, not 10.'

There are two big scenarios throughout the course, the MCI and Night Rescue.</p>\n<p>The Mass Casualty Incident, or MCI, is a 2 hours (or so) scenario designed to give students the experience of managing multiple patients with limited resources. I was a patient for this one, and unconscious for about half of it, but the main emphasis seemed to be on managing rescuer stress and deciding evac orders. (There was only one helicopter, so only one pt could be evaced at a time.)</p>\n<p>The Night Rescue mission is definitely the high-light of the course. Sadly, we all took an oath of secrecy, so as not to rob future WFR-ers of the experience. I can relate to you the weather, though: temperatures hovered above freezing, with snow forecast, but instead a downpour of rain and wind gusts of 30-40mph. I&#8217;ll also say that I&#8217;m now completely justified in packing my <a href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=728">silponcho</a> and <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2007/01/06/note-to-self-2/">wearing paracord bracelets</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall impression of the course is two thumbs up. I&#8217;d do it all over again. In fact, I&#8217;m disappointed that the re-cert class I&#8217;ll be taking in two years is only 3 days, not 10.</p>'

This course is fast-paced and engaging. You\'ll spend half your time outside of the classroom doing hands-on skills and realistic scenarios. In addition to scenarios, you\'ll participate in a full-scale night mock rescue. WMI\'s curriculum encompasses a wide range of topics including long-term patient care, wound management, straightening angulated fractures, reducing dislocations, litter packaging and administering medications. You\'ll complete this course with the tools and confidence to manage patients in the backcountry for multiple days. The intensive 80-hour curriculum is nationally recognized and supported by the Wilderness Medicine Institute\'s Medical Advisory Panel. You\'ll be taught by dynamic educators who have practiced both wilderness and urban medicine. This 10-day course is ideal for all professionals operating in remote environments.  Adult CPR certification is included. The WFR course is pre-approved for 70 hours of EMT CEU\'s by CECBEMS.</blockquote>\n\n8am-5pm for 10 consecutive days.

The book begins with a short introduction to basic first aid -- CPR, splints, and the like -- and follows that with "An A-Z Guide to Ailments and Injuries," including everything from nosebleeds to jellyfish stings.

Women love this rich green plant during pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation for its safe diuretic effect, its gentle restorative laxative effect, its assured anti-hemorrhagic power, and its contribution to their over all well-being. Antiseptic when fresh juice is used as a wash for skin, kitchen, or stable, nettle also clears auras and energetic pathways.

In the morning, the plant material was strained out of it. I drank about half of it throughout the day and the rest, used as a rinse on my hair after shampooing in the shower. I experienced a sort of buzzing, euphoric effect after pouring it over my head, though I think this may just be the combination of the refrigerator-temperature infusion in a hot shower combined with placebo.

    vellum_post_326.body = u'Tonight I sharpened two blades with my new <a href="http://spyderco.com/catalog/details.php?product=77" >Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker</a>. It\'s a set of two ceramic stones (one medium, one fine) set into a plastic base, with two brass hand guards. The base sets the stones at a 40&#176; angle (there\'s also an option for 30&#176;), allowing the user to hold the knife parallel to the base, which eliminates the fudge factor that comes with normal stones. So far, I\'m enjoying it. It\'s certainly sharpened both knives I\'ve tried on it (Leatherman Wave and BK10), though they\'re neither razor sharp. Both were pretty dull to start with, so I think it\'s just going to take a few more cycles through the Tri-Angle before I can get them up to speed.\n\nThe Wave had a small cink in the blade that the medium stone was able to take care of. The BK10 has a significantly larger cink that the medium stone shaved down a bit, but it\'s still there. Again, I think I\'ll be able to take care of it with a bit more work. If not it may be worth it just to take it in to a professional sharpener so I can start with a clean slate.\n\nMy only complaint about the Tri-Angle is the cheap plastic base. There\'s a variety of different slots, all made to hold the stones and guards in a variety of different configurations, but each require a little fiddling with to insert the stones and guards into. I think a metal or wood base would have been more appropriate.\n\nThe sharpener also comes with a DVD demonstrating proper use. It\'s amazing how versatile the system is -- or, at least, how versatile the DVD claims it is. It seems anything can be sharpened with the Tri-Angle. From plain edge to serrated knifes, hair clippers to toe clippers, potato peelers to screwdrivers. I may try a serrated blade on it tomorrow.\n\nThe average price on the net seems to be about $45. I picked it up for <a href="http://bestknives.stores.yahoo.net/spydtriansha.html" >$42.95</a> (those guys have amazingly fast shipping, too). At that price, I\'d say it\'s a very worthy investment.'

    vellum_post_327.body = u'The <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/10/27/fire-shelter-overnight/">fire and shelter class</a> was originally supposed to be 2.5 days. Somewhere along the line, Management cut it down to just 24 hours. Still, our teacher decided to continue with the class. We focused on shelter building, not having much time for fire.\n\nThe shelter we built was a debri-pee. Rather self explanatory -- a tee-pee, but made with debris. The group of people (there were 6 of us) sit in a circle, legs crossed, and place a stick in the ground behind their back. This marks this circumference of the circle. After this, two rows of alternating sticks, 2 feet tall, 1 foot apart, are placed around the circle. Three ridge poles, the hight of the tallest person, are setup in the middle, with their ends inside the circle, and tied off with some form of cordage at the top. Their angle should be about 45 degrees to maximize rain run-off. More ridge poles are lain around the circle -- as many as you can find and fit. Then, the lower wall (created by the circle of alternating sticks) is insulated with debris (mmm...sword ferns). Next, the upper wall (created by the ridge poles) is latticed (the lower branches of Hemlock work great -- snack on the needles while you work). Then start throwing on the debris. Sword ferns make a good first layer -- about 4 feet of insulation. Then toss on some maple leaves to minimize rain penetration. Perhaps shingle it with bark. Remember to punch a smoke hole in the top. The hole for the door should be slightly wider than the biggest person. The door itself is a plug made of vines, twigs, sticks, leaves, ferns, etc. Insulate the floor of your new home with ferns, but first lay down a little Hemlock. Remember to stash firewood anywhere and everywhere inside. Small pieces. You don\'t want to burn your new home down. Carry in a few coals from your outside fire and settle in for the night.\n\nIt took the six of us about 5 hours to construct our debri-tee. Since it\'s sized out by us all sitting cross-legged in the shelter, it\'s a bit cramped when laying down. You\'re basically sleeping in the fetal position, with your head on the next person\'s legs. But other than that, it\'s comfortable. We each had alternating one hour fire-tending shifts, to keep us warm and make sure the ferns didn\'t catch fire. It started pouring at about 3AM and rained all night, but our shelter kept us dry.\n\nWe each left with a block of cedar from which to craft a bow-drill. I\'m waiting for my new knife sharpener to arrive before I give it a shot.\n\nSpeaking of knives, our teacher, Phil, had a <a href="http://trackertrail.com/trackerknife/index.html" >Tracker knife</a> that I played with -- the custom, $400 version made by Dave Beck, not the commercial one made with crappy steel. It\'s certainly nicer than my BK10, though, overall, I can\'t say I was too impressed with it. Not for a $400 knife. I fell an Alder with it, but the saw is really too short to do much with. The handle has two positions, but felt too small for my hand. I did like cutting ferns with the dip between the chopping and carving blades.\n\nI\'m looking forward to building a debri-tee here. And transferring some of the tricks I learned to the other shelters up in the woods.'

    vellum_post_331.body = u'Before moving into my new place last month, I had planned on paying an ISP for internet access. But, complications arose with the company I had chosen, so I decided to cancel my order soon after it was placed. Instead, I planned to borrow internet access from my neighbors (hey, they\'re pumping signals into my air-space). Trouble was, everyone had encrypted their networks with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a>. No doubt this is a good thing, and a vast improvement from the last time I had scanned down here (about 8 months ago), but I wanted in. I was able to justify cracking in to myself by recognizing that my paranoia isn\'t limited just to the "others" out on the global interwebs -- no, I\'d be just as paranoid about the owner of whomever\'s network I was breaking into watching my traffic. There was no question I\'d make ample use of encryption, which, as a side benefit, meant that anything I did through his connection would be rather difficult to trace back. So, he was protected. As long as he wasn\'t paying for bandwidth by the KB, he\'d not be much affected by my leeching. (I use the pronoun "he" because I know now that the owner of my primary network is, in fact, a he -- put a password on your routers, people!).\n\nBut there was another problem, in addition to WEP: during reconnaissance, I would rarely pick up any connected clients. Perhaps I was always trying at the wrong time of day. Or perhaps people pay for internet access and never use it. Regardless, it would have taken weeks of constant logging to gather enough IVs to crack the WEP key. So, the first step was to take the money I had saved by canceling my order with the ISP, and invest in a new wireless card that supported packet injection.\n\nThe <a href="http://www.proxim.com/products/cp/pc.html" >Proxim 8470-WD</a> (from <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=faq&DokuWiki=8fb30aa7da2a84fc23999e92b8e641ca#which_is_the_best_card_to_buy" >aircrack-ng\'s recommended list</a>) caught my eye, though it took a while before I could find it a decent price. To do my initial cracking, I popped in <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/">Backtrack</a> and followed <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=newbie_guide&DokuWiki=8fb30aa7da2a84fc23999e92b8e641ca" >aircrack-ng\'s newbie guide</a>. (I had upgraded my trusty old Auditor cd to Backtrack just for this occasion. It\'s quite the nice distribution.) Within about 5 minutes, I had gained access to the first network. Goes to show how secure WEP is.\n\nThough the Proxim card is plug and play in Ubuntu, the steps to crack WEP are a little different. Here\'s what I do (note that I do recommend using Backtrack, instead).\n\nFirst, of course, one must install aircrack:\n\n<pre>sudo apt-get install aircrack</pre>\n\nYou may change your mac address manually, or, if you aren\'t concerned with anonymity, don\'t change it all. I have a preference of using the <a href="http://www.alobbs.com/macchanger/" >macchanger</a> tool:\n\n<pre>sudo apt-get install macchanger</pre>\n\nSet your card\'s MAC address randomly. In this case, the network device is at <em>ath0</em>:\n\n<pre>sudo ifconfig ath0 down\nsudo macchanger -r ath0\nsudo ifconfig ath0 up</pre>\n\nPut your card into monitor mode:\n\n<pre>sudo iwconfig ath0 mode monitor</pre>\n\nStart scanning:\n\n<pre>sudo airodump ath0 dump 0</pre>\n\nIn this case, <code>dump</code> is the file prefix for airodump\'s output and the <code>0</code> tells airodump to channel-hop. Now you want to pick your target network from the scan. It should have at least one client connected (displayed at the bottom of airodump\'s output), the more the merrier. (Hopefully that client is transmitting data, too.)\n\nWhen you pick your target, kill the first instance of airodump and start it up again, this time specifying the channel of your target:\n\n<pre>sudo airodump ath0 targetdump 9</pre>\n\nThe <code>targetdump</code> is the file prefix and <em>9</em> is the channel. Optionally you can add a <code>1</code> to the end of the command, which tells airodump to only capture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector" >IV</a>s (which is what you\'re after). I normally don\'t bother.\n\nWhen you\'ve captured somewhere in the range of 250,000 - 500,000 data packets (shown by airodump in the "Packets" column of your target client), you can start cracking:\n\n<pre>aircrack -b 00:12:34:45:78:A3 targetdump.cap</pre>\n\nIn this case, <code>-b</code> is the essid of your target network. Cracking could take minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years. I\'ve never had to wait over 20 minutes.\n\nBut what if the client is being a party-pooper and not transmitting? That\'s where packet injection comes in. From aircrack\'s guide:\n\n<blockquote>ARP works (simplified) by broadcasting a query for an IP and the device that has this IP sends back an answer. Because WEP does not protect against replay, you can sniff a packet, send it out again and again and it is still valid. So you just have to capture and replay an ARP-request targeted at the AP to create lots of traffic (and sniff IVs).</blockquote>\n\nYou\'ll want to keep airodump running, so that all the traffic you generate will be captured. In another terminal, start injecting:\n\n<pre>sudo aireplay -3 -b 00:12:34:45:78:A3 -h A3:78:45:34:12:00 ath0</pre>\n\nThe <code>-3</code> tells airepay you want to replay ARP requests, <code>-b</code> is that target network, and <code>-h</code> is the client. In a little bit, aireplay should inform you that it has captured 1 (or more) ARP packets. Sit back and watch airodump count up the IVs.\n\nIf that pesky client still isn\'t cooperating, you can give it a little motivation. From aircrack:\n\n<blockquote>Most operating systems clear the ARP cache on disconnection. If they want to send the next packet after reconnection (or just use DHCP), they have to send out ARP requests. So the idea is to disconnect a client and force it to reconnect to capture an ARP-request. A side-effect is that you can sniff the ESSID during reconnection too. This comes in handy if the ESSID of your target is hidden.\n\n...the risk that someone recognizes this attack or at least attention is drawn to the stuff happening on the WLAN is higher than with other attacks.</blockquote>\n\nKeep airodump and aireplay running, and in a new terminal give it a little kick in the butt:\n\n<pre>sudo aireplay -0 5 -a 00:12:34:45:78:A3 -c A3:78:45:34:12:00 ath0</pre>\n\nThe first switch, <code>-0</code>, informs aireplay you want to force the client to be unauthenticated, <code>-a</code> is the target network, <code>-c</code> is the target client. When the client reconnects, you should start grabbing ARP requests.\n\nAfter you have enough packets, crack the WEP key as before.\n\nTo manage and connect to my wireless networks, I\'ve taken to using <a href="http://wifi-radar.systemimager.org/" >wifi-radar</a>. It scans for networks, allows you to specify which networks you prefer and, for each network, allows you to set preferences such as the WEP key, whether to use dynamic or static addresses, and the like. What I like best is the connection commands, which allows you to set commands you want executed before wifi-radar connects to the network, and after. In the before field, I have it randomly change my mac address:\n\n<pre>ifconfig ath0 down && macchanger -r ath0 && ifconfig ath0 up</pre>\n\nAfter it connects, I restart tor:\n\n<pre>/etc/init.d/tor restart</pre>\n\n(As another reference for you, <span class="removed_link">this site</span> keeps turning up as a guide to cracking WEP in Ubuntu.)'

You can always go back to school at any age. If you are of the adventurous spirit and feel you should test yourself -- then go for it -- get out there and adventure on life. Go for broke. Go ahead and do it. I would urge you to hop a freight trains while you still can. Never mind where it\'s going or where you\'ll end up. Get that first ride under your belt and see how you like it. Get out on the highway, stick your thumb out and see what happens. Forget about a destination, just travel. Hike down some railroad track to the far horizon. Test yourself to see how far you can walk. Try spending a cold night out somewhere without blankets. Peace Pilgrim crisscrossed this country on foot for 23 years, as an older lady, with no sleeping gear. She didn\'t even wear a coat.\n\nTake a vagabond trip carrying a bedroll, but take no money, and take no credit cards. Not even a quarter for the phone. See how long you can hold out. You may be surprised to find out who your friends are. Try floating down some river on a homemade raft, Huck Finn style. Take a job on a boat, any kind of boat or ship as a workaway, never mind where it\'s going. Try some hellishly hard job of work (physically demanding). See how long you can tough it out.\n\nHike the Pacific Crest Trail. Beat your way through Canada on up to Alaska and try for a job -- any job, with no concern for the pay. Canada and Alaska come about as close as you\'ll ever get to a "lat frontier."\n\nFind your own adventure. Take the risk. Be a dare-devil. Try something new and scary. Try giving your money away.

It may come in handy, in a world where the government seems to be <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB197/index.htm" >having nukes on their mind</a>.\n\n<blockquote>Workers at Swedish nuclear power plants eat seaweed to reduce and eliminate their absorption of strontium 90, a radioactive element. Research at McGill University finds that alginic acid, one of the main components of seaweed, binds with radioactive strontium to form strontium alginate, an insoluble compound, which is rapidly eliminated from the gastro-intestinal tract, reducing the absorption of strontium 90 by fifty to ninety percent.\n\nStrontium 90, released in nuclear accidents as well as in the running of nuclear power plants, has a high affinity for calcium.

It may come in handy, in a world where the government seems to be <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB197/index.htm">having nukes on their mind</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>Workers at Swedish nuclear power plants eat seaweed to reduce and eliminate their absorption of strontium 90, a radioactive element. Research at McGill University finds that alginic acid, one of the main components of seaweed, binds with radioactive strontium to form strontium alginate, an insoluble compound, which is rapidly eliminated from the gastro-intestinal tract, reducing the absorption of strontium 90 by fifty to ninety percent.\n\nStrontium 90, released in nuclear accidents as well as in the running of nuclear power plants, has a high affinity for calcium. When released into the air, it is easily concentrated in calcium-rich foods such as milk (including mother&#8217;s milk) and leafy greens. Eat these contaminated foodstuff and the radioactivity, now combined with calcium, enters the bone marrow where it can damage delicate immune and blood cells.

Lemon juice also changes the body&#8217;s pH, making it less hospitable to viruses and bacteria.</blockquote></p>\n<p>I altered the recipe a little bit to fit the ingredients I had laying around, and the tea turned out great. A bit too much honey for my taste, but other than that, great. 16oz of the stuff is sitting in the fridge for me to try chilled tomorrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>3 cups waters</li>\n<li>5 whole garlic cloves</li>\n<li>3oz fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>\n<li>As much Italian honey as is left in the jar\n        </li></ul><ul>\n<li>The stuff was practically solid, not that cheap liquid honey you get at the supermarket. Were I to toss it into a measuring cup, I&#8217;d guess it would report about 4oz</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>2 pinches of Lemon Balm</li>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bring 3 cups water and garlic cloves to a boil</li>\n<li>When boiling, turn down heat and add lemon juice, honey, and Lemon Balm</li>\n<li>Return water to boil for 30 seconds or so, allowing chunky honey to liquefy</li>\n<li>Strain, serve, enjoy</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now if only I was sick, I could report back the medical benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> That stuff went right through me. Perhaps it cleans the kidneys?</p>\n<p><strong>Second Update:</strong> It&#8217;s tasty cold, though the honey all sunk to the bottom.</p>'

I love it. It also includes access to a 7-day online course, that I&#8217;ve yet to begin, but plan to when the time is right.</p>'

That\'s about as crazy as saying that the US is pursuing peace -- perhaps worse.\n\nI read a few days ago that Kofi wanted a peace keeping force to go to Lebanon and stop them from attacking Israel, to give Israel an excuse to stop attacking Lebanon. How can he say that? If you want to occupy someone, occupy Israel. Give Hezbollah an excuse to stop attacking them.\n\nLook at the numbers. There\'s been, what, 14 Israelis killed? And how many hundreds of Lebanon folks (Lebanonese? Something like that)? Maybe Israel just has better bomb shelters or bigger boom sticks, but, regardless the reason, they are undeniably the more dangerous, terrorizing player.\n\nHell, the guest house I checked out of this morning has a sign on the front desk proclaiming they don\'t accept Israelis because they\'ve had too much trouble with them stealing. They\'re terrorizing folks even here in Thailand.\n\nBut that was uncalled for. I\'m attacking the Israeli government, not the people. And I doubt there are many Lebanon tourists here, so it isn\'t a fair comparison.\n\nThough while I\'m on the subject of Israel, I\'d like to say that they need to stop that compulsory military service thing. It blurs the line between government and civilian, and allows Israel\'s enemies to justify killing of civilians.\n\n<strong>4:06AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>\nI\'m at my gate now. The flight boards at 6:05AM, so I\'ve about 2 hours.\n\nSecurity actually acted like they care this time. They searched my checked backpack by hand, with machine, and even confiscated the waterproof matches I always carry with my first aid kit.\n\nThose things cost like $5...\n\nMy money belt beeped going through the detector. It was just the zipper -- she didn\'t care to even unzip and look inside. I have my credit card in there, and could very easily have one of those credit card knives, too.\n\nWhile they were searching my pack, I was asked if security could ask me some questions. I said yes (did I have a choice?), but then was only asked the usual "did you pack your bag", "has it always been with you", etc. I thought they were going to take me aside and poke something up my anus. Oh well. Maybe US will want to do that.\n\n<strong>4:24AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>\nI should mention that on my way to Bangkok, I put my backpack in 2 of the heaviest-duty trash bags I could find, in hopes of protecting it from the airport conveyor belts. It came out fine.\n\nThis time, I sent it through naked. I have no doubt that the bag itself will make it -- it is, after all, military grade -- but am curious as to the fate of the straps. This is a good chance to test it, since I don\'t care so much about it going home. If it gets destroyed, I pick up another on ebay for $35.\n\n<strong>5:39AM UTC/GMT +7 hours</strong>\nThere\'s a group of about 20 American kids here in bright green shirts. Look like high school.

    vellum_post_388.body = u'<em>The following was written 7-18 on a bench in Bangkok.</em>\n\n<strong>3:10PM</strong>\nI\'m already being the stereotypical tourist, doing the whole Khao San thing and wandering the streets of Banglamphu, so, I figure, why not fall into a scam. Take the tourist image all the way.\n\nHere\'s how it worked:\n\nI was wandering down a busy street, staring at UNICEF and wondering why they need a large, gated, guarded compound that looks like a government building. A nice looking Thai walked up behind me and asks if I was searching for anything. I said no, only looking at the buildings. He asked where I was going, and I said nowhere particular. First he tried to get me to go to the Grand Palace and Wat Pho, but I told him I\'d already been there. He asked if I\'d seen the giant standing Buddha, and I told him I hadn\'t. He told me I should go because it normally costs 200 Baht, but today is a Buddhist holiday, so it\'s free. And Grand Palace and Wat Pho were no good today, anyways, them both being so crowded from the holiday visitors.\n\nAfter giving him my Lonely Planet for the map, he marked the big Buddha and Locky Temple, which I was to go to after. I told him thanks, and that I may walk that way, but he said no, tuk-tuk was better. Today, being the holiday, it would only cost 20 Baht instead of the usual 100. Just then, a tuk-tuk driver who seemed to be old friends with the Thai I was chatting with pulled up and asked if I needed a tuk-tuk. Before I could say anything, the two exchanged a few quick words in Thai and, the next thing I knew, I was in the tuk-tuk racing to the big Buddha. For 20 Baht\n\nIt was indeed free to see the statue, though I don\'t know if that was usual or not. A few minutes there and the driver said ok, he\'ll take me to the Locky Temple to see the Buddha there. When we got to the temple, I was told by someone standing around front that it was not open yet, but I could enter in 5 minutes. I waited 15, and nothing changed. I could see inside the room, and all it was was a bunch of old people eating breakfast and a few monks. It didn\'t look anything special, nor did they appear to be finishing anytime soon, so I left.\n\nThe tuk-tuk beckoned me back and I was told now he would take me to the "Thai Expo Center" for some kind of coupon. I had no idea what that meant, but thought the guy had been nice enough yet, and all this for only 20 Baht So we zoomed off and parked in front of a gem shop. Some expo, eh? He told me to go inside for the coupon, so I wandered in. Yup, it was a gem shop. I asked the guy who opened the door for a coupon for the tuk-tuk and he asked if that was all. No gem? I told him that was indeed all. He looked disappointed, but scribbled something in Thai on a piece of paper, and I left. The driver was surprised to see me come out so soon, but motioned me back in to the tuk-tuk and we took off. In a little, he pulled over and told me what\'s what.\n\nThe paper I had gotten was worthless. (I still don\'t know what was written on it.) What he was after was a free gasoline coupon that the shop would give him for bringing me. Two if I purchased something. He was the one to ask for it, not me, and I would have to stay for at least 10 minutes, looking interested in an item. I was not required to buy, though it would be nice if I did. \n\nWe would try again, he said. This time at a tailor\'s. I couldn\'t blame the guy for wanting free gas, and it wasn\'t costing me anything, save time, which I have a surplus of. Hell, he was driving me all over the district for only 20 Baht and gas here costs 28 (per what, I don\'t know).\n\nI went in to the Tailor\'s he took me to, and the greeter asked what I was interested in. Shirt, suit, jacket? I latched onto his first suggestion and replied shirt. He showed me a few up front, which I browsed through, but was disinterested in. He then led me to the back of the store and asked me if I was looking for a solid color or pattern, but I said I wasn\'t sure. By this time I was getting into it, and, when he asked me what color I wanted, I replied something darker. He showed me a few and I analyzed the craftsmanship and fabric, but, to pretend as if I actually had something in mind, I asked if he had any long-sleeved. Not here, I was told, but it could be made. No, I didn\'t want to deal with that, I told him, thinking this an easy way out. But he was insistent and handed me his card should I change my mind. To add a final little flare onto my performance, I asked to see his fabrics. He showed me, I browsed for a bit, thanked him, and told him I might be back.\n\nFeeling pleased with myself, I strutted out to the driver and asked how I was. Did I take long enough? The coupon promotion ended yesterday, he grudgingly informed me, so my performance was all for not. But he knew of another shop that would give him what he was after, so off we went.\n\nThis is a great time waster, I thought to myself. I\'m glad I fell into it.\n\nThe next shop had no showroom, so I would have to change my act. Improv. Upon entrance on stage left, I was quickly shuffled to a seat by one of those Thais whose tailor has watched Saturday Night Fever one too many times. He gave me a few catalogs to look through, saying everything in there was next year\'s model and would cost me thousands of dollars in the States. I believed him. The price, at least.\n\nI flipped through the first catalog, set it down, and looked through the second. Then I picked up the first once more, turned to a random page, and told him I liked that one. It was actually a nice looking suit and I may have been genuinely interested in it if I weren\'t morally opposed to the concept of  "dressing up". He took me over to the other side of the store and showed me the fabric. I asked him how much and he directed me to a couch. I was told to sit, while he ran off to find a calculator. (Thais rarely like to tell you a price, but will instead type it on a calculator for you to see.) He came back and showed me number: 4500 Baht.\n\nI was surprised. That honestly was a good price. I acted to hesitate and he pulled off a similar suit from the rack beside us, beckoning me to analyze the craftsmanship. I hesitated and he asked what was wrong. Too much? Student? Tight budget? A new number on the calculator: 4000. Again I hesitated and asked for a card so that I could think about it and come back. No, he said, this was a one day sale. I hesitated more, saying that 4000 Baht was a good price, but was a lot for me to put down all at once (true). After a bit of back-and-forth, I was able to escape, saying I\'d think and come back later today. He knew I had no intention of doing so. On my exit, I thought I should ask what time he closed to sound a little more interested.\n\nBack on the street, the tuk-tuk driver didn\'t look cheerful, so I didn\'t ask how I\'d done. He questioned if I\'d been to the Grand Palace. Yes, I had. Wat Pho? Yup. Long tail boats? No, hadn\'t seen those. Well, he would take me there.\n\nHe did so, I looked, snapped a couple of photos, and told the whole pier no, I didn\'t want a 700 Baht ride. I only wished to look. Dodging the post-card saleswoman best I could (but failing), I walked back to the street. The driver asked what I would do now. Walk, I said. He asked for the money, and I handed him 20 Baht, thanking him for showing me around.\n\nI really don\'t know how much was a scam. It very well could be a holiday. Perhaps he got his coupon. Maybe two. Regardless, it cost me only 20 Baht (For what is really more of a 100 Baht ride) and time. And the boats were only a block from where he picked me up.\n\nAfterwards, I wandered down the street to stumble upon a bakery that happened to serve slices of expensive (by Thai standards) and excellent chocolate cake.\n\nI haven\'t done much since then.\n\nYesterday\'s initial shock is wearing off, and I\'m once again taking a liking to Bangkok. We have a funny relationship, the city and I.'

The price, at least.</p>\n<p>I flipped through the first catalog, set it down, and looked through the second. Then I picked up the first once more, turned to a random page, and told him I liked that one. It was actually a nice looking suit and I may have been genuinely interested in it if I weren&#8217;t morally opposed to the concept of  &#8220;dressing up&#8221;. He took me over to the other side of the store and showed me the fabric. I asked him how much and he directed me to a couch. I was told to sit, while he ran off to find a calculator. (Thais rarely like to tell you a price, but will instead type it on a calculator for you to see.) He came back and showed me number: 4500 Baht.</p>\n<p>I was surprised. That honestly was a good price. I acted to hesitate and he pulled off a similar suit from the rack beside us, beckoning me to analyze the craftsmanship. I hesitated and he asked what was wrong. Too much? Student? Tight budget? A new number on the calculator: 4000. Again I hesitated and asked for a card so that I could think about it and come back. No, he said, this was a one day sale. I hesitated more, saying that 4000 Baht was a good price, but was a lot for me to put down all at once (true). After a bit of back-and-forth, I was able to escape, saying I&#8217;d think and come back later today. He knew I had no intention of doing so. On my exit, I thought I should ask what time he closed to sound a little more interested.</p>\n<p>Back on the street, the tuk-tuk driver didn&#8217;t look cheerful, so I didn&#8217;t ask how I&#8217;d done. He questioned if I&#8217;d been to the Grand Palace. Yes, I had. Wat Pho? Yup. Long tail boats? No, hadn&#8217;t seen those. Well, he would take me there.</p>\n<p>He did so, I looked, snapped a couple of photos, and told the whole pier no, I didn&#8217;t want a 700 Baht ride. I only wished to look. Dodging the post-card saleswoman best I could (but failing), I walked back to the street. The driver asked what I would do now. Walk, I said. He asked for the money, and I handed him 20 Baht, thanking him for showing me around.</p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know how much was a scam. It very well could be a holiday. Perhaps he got his coupon. Maybe two. Regardless, it cost me only 20 Baht (For what is really more of a 100 Baht ride) and time. And the boats were only a block from where he picked me up.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, I wandered down the street to stumble upon a bakery that happened to serve slices of expensive (by Thai standards) and excellent chocolate cake.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t done much since then.</p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s initial shock is wearing off, and I&#8217;m once again taking a liking to Bangkok. We have a funny relationship, the city and I.</p>'

I can't figure out how to spell or pronounce it.\n\nPerhaps I was naive, thinking I'd complete the trip with no more worries than where to throw my used toilet paper. Where I'm staying tonight, I've finally had to come face-to-face with the horror of an Asian squat toilet.\n\nI suppose they're not that bad, really. Just odd. There's not even a pressure washer this time. Just a bucket of water. Luckily, I have a fresh roll of toilet paper with me. The strange thing is that, despite the toilet's size, there's only one small little hole for everything to go down, and that one little hole is the only place with water. So if you miss it, it all just kinda sits there. You have to try to wash it down with the bucket of water. And then of course it doesn't flush, so after you get it in the hole, it all just sits there.\n\nDoesn't seem like the most intelligent design to me. I must be missing something.\n\nI ordered deep fried shrimp for lunch today, but didn't expect everything on the plate to come deep fried and battered. Deep fried asparagus? That's just wrong.\n\nIt has been getting progressively hotter as I inch down south (though I'm still in the North). The AC on the bus from Sukhothai today was broken. It was only an hour, but by the time that was through, I was praising the 95F coolness of the open air.\n\nTomorrow it's back to Bangkok. I went to buy a seat on the train, thinking that would be more comfortable and scenic than a bus, if slower. Choices with AC were limited, so I had to get on the 8:59AM train, and I'm not sure if I have a wooden seat or what. I will have to wake up early. Luckily the station is only about 3 blocks away.\n\nThe guest house here doesn't provide a top sheet. I'll have to break out my silk sleeping bag liner tonight.\n\nI don't yet know where I'll be sleeping tomorrow, but I'm considering braving Khao San Road. I did my best to avoid it the last time I was in Bangkok. But a trip to Thailand doesn't seem complete without at least a quick visit to the infamous ghetto.\n\nMy flight home is something like 5AM on the 19th, which means I'll have to spend the night in the airport. Otherwise I'd have to worry about finding a guest house with an insomniac receptionist who would allow me to check out at 3AM, and then try to find a metered taxi. All unlikely.\n\nAt least I'll have plenty of time to get through security...\n\nThanks to the magic of something-or-other, I think I'm due to arrive in Seattle only 5 hours later at 10AM. That is, as long as the hyperdrive isn't busted. And Atton isn't our pilot.\n\nThere's only one thing I want see in Phitsanulok, and that's a Buddha image in a Wat up north. He's supposed to have some sort of dragon-flame-halo thing. The map makes it look to be out of walking distance in this heat, so I'm putting it off.\n\nThere are supposed to be a couple tasty boat restaurants on the river up that way. Perhaps I'll catch a tuk-tuk up there this evening and have dinner after I visit the Wat.\n\nThere was a monk eating at the restaurant where I took lunch today. Aren't they supposed to be, you know, begging and stuff? At least the count of nicotine addict monks is still only 1.\n\nI hope all of you are enjoying reading this, and are thankful for my choosing to publish it. It seems most of the entries are full of my complaints. I suppose that's the danger of traveling alone, with no one to whine to. I live the good moments as they come, and when I sit down to write, all that's left is the bad.\n\nThere's some good in it, I think."

It is "a handbook for the use of an ancient Oracle: the Viking Runes". It tells of their meaning and ways of their use. They are not so much a form of divination, of future telling or fairy-tale magic, but a challenge to look into yourself. By using the runes in search of an answer, you find your own interpretation and project what you already know, but perhaps do not wish to express, onto the stones. Their symbols, sounds, and arrangements seem almost arbitrary.

He proposes that systems such as ours, where the sounds and the symbols themselves bear little to no resemblance to anything of the sensuous world, serves to cut us off from the that world -- he assaults (with the alphabet, of course) this the same way Daniel Quinn assaults agriculture. Seeing the runes through these animist eyes, one wonder why they\'re to be used as an oracle. Question their validity. Their symbols have no reference to the natural world, nor do their sounds. This unlike, for instance, the Hebrew aleph-beth, the first letter of which meant ox and looked like an ox. Indeed, Odin happened upon the runes one day while torturing his own body -- attempting to transcend the sensuous, and thus the whole of the natural world. From my limited understanding of the runes and their origins, I must be skeptic of their use, even if it is unimportant. I would prefer a more natural gateway within.\n\nStill, a good read.

I walked around town a little -- not a challenging feat in this place -- but all was closed. So I found a small little park, perhaps 20ft x 20ft, right next to the Tourist Police station. It had a couple trees that looked like they could provide rain cover, and a bench to lay on. I was able to get a little sleep before the sun came up.\n\nNow I\'m sitting on a pile of dirt across the street from the guest house I want to try, ants crawling all over me. The gate to the guest house is still closed, despite the sun being up and the city being awake.\n\nAs I said, the "mini bus" was a van. Packed with rows of seats, we were able to squeeze in 11 people, with one sitting on the stick shift. (Remember when I said I was the 15th to sign up?) Thais love to overbook. And let\'s not even start on how they attempted to fit all the luggage. I think that a normal bus to Chiang Mai and then back north would have been a better deal, and more comfortable.\n\nThe guest house isn\'t showing signs of waking, and a rooster felt the urge to walk up to me and start making loud, annoying noises, so I think I\'ll wander around and find breakfast.\n\n<strong>8:18AM</strong>\nThe idea of me coming here was to spend the night and then jump on the river boat to Chiang Rai tomorrow, where from I could bus back to Chiang Mai at some point. Now I\'m of the mind just to leave on the boat today -- there isn\'t much to hold me here. I look forward to a 3 hour float down the river.\n\n<strong>4:14PM</strong>\nI\'ve arrived in Chiang Rai!\n\nWhether or not there would be a boat today was questionable. Because of gas prices, they only leave if there are 6 people. I was the first, and until just 30 minutes before the scheduled departure, there were only 5.\n\nI seem to be getting used to sleeping on park benches, which I did all morning. The locals weren\'t able to get used to seeing a scruffy, long-haired, white guy taking a nap in their park, though. I might be starting to smell... Perhaps I should bite the bullet and pay to get real laundry done?\n\nAs I was lying on the bench, three hill tribe women came up, selling their wares. Though none of us spoke a common language, we carried out a conversation for a bit. It was fun.\n\nToday turned out to be Buddhist Lent, which meant the banks are all closed. A Swiss and her Thai boyfriend were all out of Baht, and needed to get to Chiang Rai so that the Swiss could reach her flight home. They asked me to spot them the 600 Baht for two boat tickets, which I did, and promised to pay me back when we docked at Chiang Rai -- they would have a friend waiting at the pier who could pay me. To be honest, I didn\'t really care if they could pay me back or not. I happened to have the Baht on me, and they needed to get to Chiang Rai. And that\'s it.\n\nIn a Buddhist country, it doesn\'t matter whether you believe in Karma or not. It just is.\n\nI enjoyed the ride in the long tail boat. They sit so low that it feels like you\'re skimming on water. The views (of the parts I didn\'t sleep through) were wonderful. Not a road in site. Just green, green hills.\n\nWhen we got to Chiang Rai, the Thai-Swiss couple\'s friend was there with the money. He was a fat old man, whom I was told was a "medicine man". I named him Bullfrog.\n\nThe couple had previously offered to drive me to any guest house I wanted, which I took them up on -- a good thing, as there were no taxis waiting at the boats. We jumped in Bullfrog\'s little car and zipped through town, defying every traffic law one could. Not even the Buddhist Lent Parade stopped us -- we pulled right in, weaving through the monks and nuns.\n\nThey were driving down to Nan tomorrow, and offered me a free ride, but I declined. I want a couple nights in Chiang Rai before I bus south to Chiang Mai.\n\nNow I sit in the guest house. It\'s nothing much to look at, but has two strong fans and screen doors on the opposite sides of the room for bug-free ventilation.\n\nIt\'s been exceptionally hot today. I look forward to a cool night in a bed -- certainly superior to a night stuck in the back corner of a van, swerving to miss bumps, but still hitting them, in a sit leaning forward from the pressure of the bags behind it.\n\n<strong>5:46PM</strong>\nUh oh. Found another ice cream shop. They have something called a "chocolate trio". That\'s like, chocolate 3 times. Must be good. We\'ll see.'

There\'s a stand across the street selling BBQ Pork. I\'ve been contemplating crossing the street for a couple of pieces the last 20 minutes or so. Keep hoping the rain will let up. If I do get soaked, I won\'t have any guaranteed place to dry off in.\n\nA dry restaurant is a tempting place to kill a little time, but I\'m not hungry enough for a full meal.\n\nIt\'s funny to see Muslim women decked out in their black robes and headdresses cruising down the street on their motorcycles.\n\nI respect them for being able to wear all that in the heat.\n\nThere is a poncho in my daypack...\n\nI\'ve seen a couple minivans with "Aya Services" plastered on the side. That\'s probably my ride for tonight.\n\nIs taking off in the dark of night, on the windy, steep roads that are surely by now wet and muddy, the greatest idea?\n\nA guy just got on his motorcycle dressed in a shiny silver rain suit -- coat and pants. He looks like a space man.\n\nAn angry mother screeched her SUV to a halt and yelled at two kids across the street at the noodle stand.\n\nI\'m not having much luck waiting the rain out.\n\nWaiting for the words to come.

It was rather cool and misty (not to mention down hill), so was much easier than yesterday. The English girl had trouble with the slope --  she slipped and fell a lot. I did once.\n\nAn hour later we were at the elephant camp and rode them around in a loop for 45 minutes. They didn\'t seem to be treated very well. Not much worse than any animal in captivity, I suppose, but weren\'t as happy as the Elephants in the royal stable in Ayuthaya.\n\nFrom there it was on to white water rafting with another group. It wasn\'t anything serious, but there were a few good splashes. Fun.\n\nWe beached the rafts after about 30 minutes and jumped on bamboo rafts, which was a lot of fun and incredibly wet. With the weight of people, the bamboo sinks a few inches beneath the surface, so you\'re actually sitting in the river. The water was shallow enough that one probably would have stayed drier just walking down it.\n\nThey fed us lunch and trucked us back to guest house.\n\nIt was a good time. I\'d recommend the trek to anyone who can walk.\n\nMy pack at the guest house had been untouched. Same with the "security" envelope, so that\'s a relief.\n\nAfter I picked up my stuff from Kristi\'s, I caught a tuk-tuk to a hostel a few blocks north. When I arrived, they told me they were full. The tuk-tuk driver (who was the same as the one who drove me to Monk Chat, so we knew each other) offered to take me to any other hostel I wished, for free. But the second one I chose was also full. The driver didn\'t mind, so I asked him to take me to another on the other side of town. It was more expensive, but I\'d walked by it a few times previously and it looked nice enough.\n\nThey only had a room for one night, and I wanted 2. The lady at the desk said she\'d find me another room for tomorrow. At least I have somewhere to crash tonight.\n\nThe rooms are similar to Kristi, but much nicer. There\'s also a TV, which was a surprise. I took a long shower and did a little laundry in there too.\n\nNow I\'m eating a bit of dinner and afterwards I think I might wander over to the night bazaar again.\n\nI\'m not feeling very motivated to write in this at the present moment, but figure I ought to at least try to bring it up to date.\n\nMy pen is running out of ink.

The front desk must close early because only the after-hours security guard was there. He spoke very little English, but managed to get me a room.\n\nI can\'t say I\'m very impressed with the place. It\'s more of a hotel than a guest house. The rooms are very plain and impersonal. I didn\'t think of this at the time, but I probably shouldn\'t have taken guest house advice from a smoker. Smoking is allowed in all the rooms here. But that doesn\'t bother me -- if it weren\'t for the ashtray and sign that asks you not throw butts out the window, I probably wouldn\'t know. What bothers me is the smell of the horrible strongly scented cleaner they must use to mask the smoke.\n\nBut for 200 Baht, it\'s a very good deal. I have a queen size bed and a private bathroom.\n\nAfter checking in last night I headed down the block to the Sunday Night Market, a seemingly endless row of craft vendors. Had I not been limited by the space in my backpack, it would be incredibly hard to hold on to my Baht. As it was, I just feasted on a variety of food and fresh-squeezed juices.\n\nI seem to have lucked out in location. There are excellent restaurants all over the place. I\'ll be putting on some weight here.\n\nToday for breakfast I had a sort of noodle soup with chicken and vegetables. They also had chocolate milk shakes, so I indulged, even though I should be avoiding dairy.\n\nThis morning I signed up for a trek. 1,100 Baht for 2 days, 1 night. Elephant riding, white-water rafting, bamboo rafting, hill-tribes, and all of that. We leave tomorrow at 9:30AM. (Tomorrow is the 4th of July? It seems it was just the 1st yesterday.) I chose the short trek because I think I\'ll be doing more of them as my journey continues.\n\nAfter I get back from the Trek, I think I\'ll spend one more night in Chiang Mai (not at Kristi). Then I\'m considering following the "Northern Loop" itinerary in Lonely Planet till I get distracted and decide to break off.\n\nOne thing I\'ve decided for sure that I want to do is stay at the Akha Hill House, a remotely located guest house run by the Akha tribes people. It sound like a nice place to stay and do little for a few days, plus they organize overnight stays in the surrounding jungle with guides who build huts and cook with bamboo. It\'ll be like a Ray Mears TV show... kinda.\n\nI\'m enjoying Chiang Mai. It\'s much calmer than Bangkok, and less smelly. It\'s just as hot in the day, but a little cooler at night. Surprisingly, there\'s an incredible amount of Farang here. Much more so than Bangkok. You can\'t walk a block without seeing another white person.\n\nThe architecture of the Wats is very cool -- sort of a Buddhist spin on Ronan from Lord of the Rings -- but they\'re small and all rather similar, so there\'s little sight seeing to do here in that department.'

I look forward to meeting their inhabitants, animal and other.\n\n<strong>5:45PM</strong>\nI stopped writing before due to the bumpiness of the ride, but it\'s better now. Where was I?\n\nI went on the tour with 4 other folks from the guest house. A French couple and an Irish couple. We cruised to the first Wat, which had a large tower in the center you could climb up. Inside, there were 5 Buddhas surrounding a deep shaft in the center. Bats flew all over the roof. I didn\'t want to scare them with my flash, so I avoided taking many pictures.\n\nOne thing I particularly enjoy about the ruins in Thailand is that one is free to explore and climb all over them. So unlike many historical objects and sites in the West, which one is rarely allowed to even touch.\n\nFrom there, it was to the royal elephant stable. We pet, fed, and watched the elephants bathe. One baby couldn\'t get enough of me. She kept attempting to eat my foot and, when that wasn\'t working, decided she would wrap her trunk around my leg and go for the whole thing. She was strong enough to lift my leg and I was soon on all fours for balance. Later, when I turned around to leave, she grabbed my backpack and held me there.\n\nBy the time we were done with the elephants, it was pouring like I had never seen, with thunder and lightning, too.\n\nWe made another stop at a monument to the king, but one second out of the shelter of the tuk-tuk and you were taking a bath, so we canceled the rest of the tour and headed back to the guest house. Roughly an hour after that, the rain held up enough for us to venture out to a restaurant for dinner (the night market was closed due to the rain). That was my first restaurant in Thailand.\n\nThen we headed back to the guest house, reaching it a bit after 11PM. I was told the England vs. Portugal match would be "a bit of crock" (gotta love the Irish), so I watched about an hour of that.\n\nI\'m not sure what people see in soccer. It didn\'t seem anymore entertaining than other sports, perhaps less. Though I was told that this wasn\'t a very good game, what with Portugal tumbling around and crying every time they got kicked in the shin-guards. I went to bed when it was still 0-0, so I don\'t know who won.\n\nA good day.\n\nThe Irishman suggested a guest-house in Chiang Mai, so I plan to head there when I get in tonight. It\'s not listed in Lonely Planet, but he\'s stayed there 3 times, and has also done treks through them.\n\nWhen I left this morning, the Baan Lotus lady was sad to see me go. She made me promise to come back, and told me to bring a girlfriend. She also told me I was very smart, but then outlined her face, so I assume she was referring once again to my good looks.\n\nDid I mention she arranged a tuk-tuk to taxi me from the guest house to the train station?\n\nAnd so now I\'m on the train. It\'s about a 9 hour ride, with a couple hours left to go. I don\'t know where we are now, but we\'ve been stopped at this station for 5-or-so minutes. A lot of people got off -- I hope I\'m not supposed to. But it hasn\'t been 9 hours yet and I think Chiang Mai will be larger than this.\n\nLunch was served about noon. It was chicken and rice, with a side dish of what seemed to be a cross between pot-stickers and banana bread. Tasty. There were also 2 of what I can only describe as Thai chicken nuggets.\n\nThe water had ice in it -- I hope that won\'t kill me. Later, at 3PM, we were given a piece of some sort of cake and two of what resembled sugar cookies. I also got a cup or orange soda, but wasn\'t as carbonated as what you normally get in the states. I liked it better. (I also noticed that, last night, the Lemon Juice I had with dinner wasn\'t as acidic as back home.) The food here on the train is processed and microwaved -- obviously not up to street vendor par -- but kicks the shit out of what you\'re given on American trains or airplanes.\n\nThe seating is like that of an airplane. Not as comfortable as Amtrak, but nice. All in all, very good for just under 600 Baht\n\nWe\'ve begun to move again.\n\nI wonder if they\'ll serve us dinner?\n\n<strong>6:30PM</strong>\nThe scenery on the second half of the trip has been beautiful. The mist shrouded hills, rice fields. I almost feel as if I\'m in some old Vietnam movie.\n\nIt\'s not surprising the trains and buses are knocked out so much in the rainy season. Some of the hills and cliffs we pass so close to show signs of sliding in the past, and appear to want to slide again very soon. I should take pictures for my Geology professors.\n\nAs I noticed us pass by one such spectacular hill, it started pouring. An impressive site. It stopped soon after, but I wonder what would happen if the track was covered in front of us?\n\nWhat with the greenery and clouds that have been with us ever since, it at times looks as if I could be back home in the Pacific Northwest. I wonder if it\'s hot and muggy out there? It doesn\'t look it, but the train has AC and, knowing Thailand, it probably is.\n\nMy seat is stuck in the back position.\n\nMost people, I think, take the night train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. I prefer this. It\'s cheaper than a sleeper train and you can see what you\'re moving through. Plus we\'re fed, which I doubt happens on the night train.\n\nYet another lengthy stop we\'re making.\n\nThis could very well be my first day in Thailand without eating a pineapple. I\'ve been averaging at least one whole one from street vendors a day.\n\n<strong>6:53PM</strong>\nThais love to ask where Farang are from. I always respond "United States" and most of the time they understand, but sometimes I have to say "American". I\'ve often used the word to refer to myself in opposition to, say, Canadians, but I don\'t understand it. Are not Canadians, Mexicans, and Patagonians just as American as those of us in the USA? It seems to me that all residents of North America, Central America, and South America are equally American. Claiming otherwise would be to say that only Germans are Europeans or Laoations the only Asians. I wonder if Bush realizes the implications when he claims to do something for America or Americans.\n\n...I wonder if Bush realizes the implications of anything he says.\n\n<strong>7:05PM</strong>\nIt\'s the density of the trees and the rest of the greenery that really awes me here. You don\'t get this back home. It\'s such that one can hardly imagine something like what I\'m seeing now is even possible. Untouched.\n\nAnd the houses. We pass small tin shacks, with nothing more cleared away than the space needed for the building. No yards, no driveways.\n\nThe telephone polls and occasional power station are out of place here.\n\nWe\'re now stopped at "Khan Tan".\n\n<strong>7:14PM</strong>\nWhat\'s with these long stops? Earlier we would stop at stations for no more than a minute, but now it\'s no less than 10. I hope I\'m not supposed to be getting off.'

Instead, I got lost and walked around the city for 3 hours. I think I'm getting over the heat now -- though I say that sitting here in an air-conditioned mall. No, I don't think I am getting over it. I'm drinking a lot more water, though. That helps.\n\n7-11 here is like Starbucks in the States. There's one on every corner, and if there isn't room in a building, they setup in a booth on the sidewalk. A large bottle of water is 9 Baht. I've probably gone through 5 today. I'm really going to have to pee tonight.\n\nDid you know that your body uses a lot of heat keeping your pee warm? So if you're setting down for a cold night in the woods, take a good piss before bed so that your body can use that heat for better purposes. Random fact from survival training.\n\nThere's a Baskin Robbins here. I had a scoop of chocolate. Man, that was good. They brought me a glass of ice water, too. Ice is generally a no-no here, but it looked to cold too pass up. So if I die in the next day or two, sue Baskin Robbins.\n\nI'm debating whether I want to see a movie or not. There's three theatres in the Siam Square area. All of them are playing Superman Returns, except for the one in this building, which is also showing Tokyo Drift. Neither of the films really appeal to me. There's ads for Dead Man's Chest all over the city.\n\nToday is my last day in Bangkok. At least that was the idea. Now I'm starting to like the city. I don't know. Maybe I'll head north tomorrow, maybe I won't. This is the last night I have reserved at the Suk 11, though.\n\nI was planning on heading over to the station today to seeing about getting a train or bus ticket to somewhere for tomorrow, but that never happened. So I guess I'll just wing that -- hopefully I can buy the ticket a few hours before departure. I'm thinking about heading to Ayuthaya, and from there to Chiang Mai. Perhaps I'll stop at Lopburi, but that seems to be the same thing as Ayuthaya, plus gangs of monkeys.\n\nThe Buddhist monks walking around the city aren't exactly what I was expecting. Something about monks with cell phones and digital cameras just doesn't seem right. I saw a tour bus full of monks at one Wat.\n\nThe Speakeasy speed test says I'm getting 1.4k down and 134k up. That's from the Seattle node.\n\nI clicked on the little thing that was giving me a count down of how much time I have left and now it went away. Doh.\n\nThe food stalls in Bangkok are awesome. I've been snacking all day. But I think I might grab dinner here. Did I mention there's a KFC and McDonald's? Depressing.\n\nIt's sad that us Farang have to be so weary of Thai approaching us in the street. The vast majority are incredibly friendly. This morning while I was walking down the street from the hostel, two guys at a tuk-tuk stopped me. One tried to tell me that the Grand Palace was closed today, but the other guy shut him up. He said that traffic was too bad for a tuk-tuk, thus giving up money for himself. He then said I should take a motorcycle and, when I agreed, ran down the block to get me one. I was worried that the driver would try to take me to some silk/gem shop or some other scam, but he went straight to the Grand Palace and asked for the previously agreed upon price. Throughout the day, other Thais stopped me on the street. Some wanted me to buy something or tried to tell me something was closed, but the majority just wanted to talk. They always get excited when they hear I'm an American. Not sure why.\n\nAs nice as this mall is, the Thai music is getting to me. Not as bad as Japanese pop, but bad. I think -- yup, they're playing Spice Girls now.\n\nI went to a weapon museum in the Grand Palace today. There was a whole lot of blades there. Guns, too. Speaking of which, I stumbled upon this two block stretch that was nothing but gun shops. I bet I could walk out of there with enough arms to start a small army, with not even an ID check. Bangkok is funny like that. They should have filmed Blade Runner here.\n\nWell, I think I'm going to see about dinner. Long live the king, and all that."

    vellum_post_439.body = u'<em>The following was written 6-29, in Bangkok</em>\n\n<strong>8:30AM BK Time</strong>\nThe plane ride to Bangkok was uneventful. I slept all of the way. We arrived a little early. 11:30PM, I think. After going through Passport Control, I went to collect my backpack -- which, thankfully, made it through unscathed. On my way out of the airport terminal, lots of private taxi companies tried to give me a ride to the red light district. I ignored them, and went out to wait for the Airport Bus, which is supposed to run every 30 minutes till 00:30 (I have to get used to 24-hr time. Everyone uses it here), but the bus never came. So I walked over to get a meter taxi.\n\nOf course, I luck out and get the taxi driver who keeps moaning like he\'s going to pass out right there and keeps an empty cigarette box next to him that he spits in every few minutes. His English was more or less limited to "Name hotel?" and even after I gave him the direction card to the hostel, the best he could do was get me to the right street. Not the best experience, and I\'ve been avoiding taxis since.\n\nAfter wandering around the Soi (side street) for a while, a taxi driver and two different tuk-tuk drivers helped me find where I was supposed to go. Their friendliness made up for the taxi ride. So after walking around for about 20 minutes at 1AM, I arrive at the hostel, dripping sweat.\n\nAfter checking in, I drop dead on the first empty bed in the dorm that I see.\n\nI woke up the next day around 8AM -- in time for the hostels free breakfast of bread and fruit. Quite tasty, especially after airplane food. After that, I ventured out and explored most all of the areas that the Skytrain went to (it\'s cheap and air-conditioned). Plenty of people tried to sell me cheap tours and prostitutes, which got annoying after a while. Around 2PM I cam back to the air-conditioned dorm room, figuring I\'d read a little and maybe take a nap. As soon as I got on the bed I was out.\n\nI woke up around 8PM, but it was dark out and, for some reason, I wasn\'t hungry, so I just thought "screw it" and went back to sleep. Not exactly smart, as sleeping half the day isn\'t going to help me get over jet lag. Though I think my exhaustion is more from heat than the time zone. I woke up this morning at 7AM, took a cold shower and washed my shirt, underwear, and socks. Then I went down to breakfast, and now I sit on my bed, writing this.\n\nI\'m not looking forward to going out again today, but know I should (and stay out -- all day). Bangkok is chaotic, hot, and smells worse than Tacoma. Which isn\'t to say it\'s all bad, but I\'m looking forward to moving on. I suppose today I should go out and do all the tourist stuff. The Skytrain is really limited and only takes you around "new" Bangkok. All the tourist stuff is near the river in "old" Bangkok, so I don\'t know how I\'ll get there. An air-con taxi sounds nice, but is probably the most expensive option. Perhaps I should figure out how the bus system works.\n\nIt\'s going to be hot. It\'s probably about 75-80F here in the air-conditioned room -- about the top of my comfort level. And it\'s only 9AM. It rained a little yesterday, but that didn\'t help it cool down any. Well, I guess I\'ll go brave the streets. Wish me luck. I need to get to an ATM, too.\n\n<strong>10:00AM BK Time</strong>\nYou haven\'t lived till you\'ve risked life and limb, weaving in and out of the streets of Bangkok on the back of a motorcycle. (They should make a Fast and the Furious movie here.) I was worried the driver wouldn\'t take me to the right place, but he did. 150 Baht later, I\'m at the Grand Palace. IT\'d be nice to get a tour guide to tell me what I\'m looking at, but I\'m to cheap for that.\n\nThere\'s hundreds of people here. White is still a minority.\n\nAah, a breeze...\n\nI wonder if I got lice from that motorcycle helmet.\n\n<strong>1:35PM Bangkok Time</strong>\nI\'m at Wat Pho now. Home of the giant Reclining Buddha and the Thai Massage School. I think next I\'ll go to the National Museum, which is probably air-conditioned. By the way, I\'ve devised a new system to find one\'s way around Bangkok. I found Wat Pho by walking in the general direction and waiting for someone to approach me and tell me the Wat was closed today. If I stopped hearing that, I picked another direction to walk in. And it worked! After all, here I am.\n\nI find Thais are much more friendly here in the tourist part of town. I\'m not topped every block by a tuk-tuk driver offering me a tour, because I\'m already here.\n\nThough I love the Suk 11, I wish it was in a better location.\n\nOh, I have plans for tonight: an air-con movie theatre! There\'s a couple in Siam Square and from there I can Skytrain back to the Suk.\n\nA cat just jumped on the bench with me. There are a lot of stray cats and dogs around Bangkok.\n\nThere\'s lots of school groups the Wats, too. The little girls all get really excited if you wave and say hello. It\'s funny. I kinda feel sorry for them in their uniforms. Must be hot.'

    vellum_post_449.body = u'The <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/03/29/survival-walk-about/">last three days</a> was an interesting sort of journey filled with pain and learning that I wouldn\'t pass up for anything. I hope to do it again.\n\nRather than calling it a <span class="removed_link">walk-about</span>, I\'d say it was a 3-Day Hunter-Gatherer Experience. We hunted, we gathered, and we walked. Then we walked some more. Calling it a walk-about misses the root.\n\nHere follows a quick overview of the events. Hopefully I\'ll post more later.\n\nFriday morning brought with it thunder, lightning, and rain that bordered on hale. Luckily, we were doing some incredibly dense bush-whacking, which covered us partially from the rain. The sun came out and cleared things up at around noon (watches weren\'t allowed, so I don\'t have much of an idea about time), drying our band of 11 out just in time to cross a river. Here begins the saga of the 3 days of wet feet, socks, and boots.\nThe river was only about crotch deep, but had a fairly strong current on the opposite bank. Instead of doing it one by one, we crossed in two lines, parallel to the river. The largest person in each group was in the front of the group with a walking stick, so the rest of us could move in his eddy. We all grabbed the person\'s waist (or pack) in front of us and pressed down, helping to stabilize them. I think this is probably the safest way to cross a steam. We succeeded without incident.\nThere was a nice beach on the opposite bank, so we hung out there for a while and practiced flint-knapping. I discovered I\'m horrible at it, and have much better luck just finding pre-chipped rocks along the walk. We sloshed on for a while, stopping every now and then to ring out socks (which didn\'t help at all). At one point we had to climb up a waterfall, who\'s side was all loose, saturated clay. That was an interesting climb, but it guaranteed us all our first solid layer of dirt covering our whole body. Oh, it made my feet wetter, too. Speaking of wet, we also had to cut through a couple swamps, which didn\'t help things much.\nThe emphasize of the experience was on wandering, so the instructors didn\'t want to take hours to build shelters, only to move on to another the next night. As such, we brought two tarps. Camp that night consisted of the two tarps tied between trees in an A-frame, which a few hundred ferns used for insulation on the bottom. All 11 of us snuggled up close to each other for body-warmth (it really makes a world of difference -- even touching in only one spot). Dinner, by the way, was cat tail. The stalks were pretty tasty raw, and the roots not bad when roasted, but now whenever I hear "cat tail" mentioned, or even just think of them, I get a queezy feeling in my stomach as if I\'m about to throw up. They didn\'t sit that well with me. Other than that, we had snacked on some salmon berries, mint, and a little hemlock throughout the day. Hunger wasn\'t a problem for me, or any of us. In fact, had our feet been dry, it probably would have been a comfortable night (all of us tried to dry our boots and socks out around the fire, but that didn\'t help much). All in all, I\'d say we covered about 7-8 miles that day through the roughest terrain of the journey.\n\nSaturday was hell day. Left over cat tail wasn\'t terribly appealing that morning, so none of us had any sort of breakfast. I\'d have to guess that we covered about 20 miles that day. Our leader, Johnny, was some kind of ninja. If it wasn\'t for the long braided hair, beard, and tendency to walk barefoot, I\'d swear he was some kind of retired Special Forces -- there was just no way any of us could keep up with his pace. That day he made me push and exceed my body\'s limits. Luckily, we fished for an hour or so in the afternoon and caught 7 trout for dinner. A little later on down the road, we caught 4 gardner snakes. That was the first time I\'d ever decapitated, skinned, and gutted a snake. It was also the first time I\'d ever eaten raw snake egg. They taste like a buttery egg yolk, but squirm a little in your mouth. With the prospect of meat for dinner, the band\'s spirit raised a little, but, as I said, Johnny pushed all of us (including the other two instructors) to our limits with his pace. By the time we arrived at what would be that night\'s camp site, the majority of the group had injured themselves in one way or another. One of the guys vomited up a serving of salmon berries. I felt as if I was on the verge of vomiting from fatigue, but didn\'t. It\'s really quite amazing how something as simple as a fire can make one feel infinitely better. As soon as the flames jumped to life, my illness went away and I felt only tired.  Though none of it really looked appetizing at the time, we feasted that night on trout, snake (which tastes a bit like jerky), and beaver (a unique meat, that somewhat resembles duck). Meat did a good deal to boost our spirits further -- specifically the beaver.\nThe fire was successful in drying my socks and boots that night, so I slept much warmer than the previous night (but still cold).\n\nSunday we didn\'t have far to walk, so we spent the morning and early afternoon around camp chatting and working with bow drills. We didn\'t have time to make our own, but two of the instructors had brought theirs for us to use. Everyone was able to get a coal and flames, which was amazing. It tired my arm a great deal, but isn\'t as hard as it\'s made out to be. I\'d like to take a class in just that so that I could learn more and make my own set. Brunch for me was left-over beaver ribs. The day\'s journey did require us to walk through another bog, which meant I once more had wet feet. The last hour or so I decided that going barefoot would be easier, though my blisters don\'t quite agree with that decision now. At the pickup point, the van driver brought us some watermelon and cooked us up some miso soup, which was incredible. I really have a new appreciation for food after this whole thing. When I got back to my car, even the warm Clif bar in my glove box was delicious.\n\nNow I\'m home, indulging myself in large quantities of food that hopefully will not make me vomit, and attempting to nurse myself back to health before I take off for Thailand. My feet are blistered, I have a few bug bites scattered around, and, worst of all, my hands are covered in blisters and other wounds. It\'s hurting a deal to type this, so that\'ll be all for now.\n\nMore later.'

Unlike most sacred texts, I found this one to be quite accessible. It\'s written in a way that, even in translation, flows and is easy to understand. I did have trouble pronouncing many of the names, but for that just ask your friendly neighborhood Guatemalan.\n\nWhen the first humans were created (on the gods\' third attempt), they had perfect sight. The gods were worried that, being able to see "the four sides, the four corners in the sky, on the earth," these humans\' deeds would rival their own, so they took the sight away. The name Popul Vuh translates to Council Book. It is said that the Quich&eacute; lords would sit with the this book in council and, using the original hieroglyphic version (which is now either lost or hiding) as a celestial guide, could regain the lost sight.\n<blockquote>They knew whether war would occur; everything they saw was clear to them. Whether there would be death, or whether there would be famine, or whether quarrels would occur, they knew it for certain, since there was a place to see it, there was a book. "Council Book" was their name for it.</blockquote>\n\nMel Gibson\'s upcoming film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472043/" >Apocalypto</a> is supposed to be partially based on these myths. Hopefully the book will gain more attention because of it.'

It tells of the gods&#8217; creation of the earth-sky, their attempts to create humans, the exploits of the <a href="http://rewild.info/anthropik/2006/06/the-trickster-the-devil-and-an-ambiguous-world/">trickster</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunahpu">Hunahpu</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbalanque">Xbalanque</a>, and the times of the first humans. Unlike most sacred texts, I found this one to be quite accessible. It&#8217;s written in a way that, even in translation, flows and is easy to understand. I did have trouble pronouncing many of the names, but for that just ask your friendly neighborhood Guatemalan.</p>\n<p>When the first humans were created (on the gods&#8217; third attempt), they had perfect sight. The gods were worried that, being able to see &#8220;the four sides, the four corners in the sky, on the earth,&#8221; these humans&#8217; deeds would rival their own, so they took the sight away. The name Popul Vuh translates to Council Book. It is said that the Quich&eacute; lords would sit with the this book in council and, using the original hieroglyphic version (which is now either lost or hiding) as a celestial guide, could regain the lost sight.\n<blockquote>They knew whether war would occur; everything they saw was clear to them. Whether there would be death, or whether there would be famine, or whether quarrels would occur, they knew it for certain, since there was a place to see it, there was a book. &#8220;Council Book&#8221; was their name for it.</blockquote></p>\n<p>Mel Gibson&#8217;s upcoming film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472043/">Apocalypto</a> is supposed to be partially based on these myths. Hopefully the book will gain more attention because of it.</p>'

Unlike hierarchy, rhizome cannot suffer exploitation from within because its structure remains incompatible with centralization of power. It provides a structural framework for our conscious organization of memes. Each node in a rhizome stands autonomous from the larger structure, but the nodes work together in a larger network that extends benefits to the node without creating dependence. The critical element of a world that focuses power at the level of the individual, that can meet the demands of our genome while providing the flexibility and potential to achieve greater goals, remains the small, connected and relatively self-sufficient node of this rhizome structure. In human terms, such a node represents an economic and a cultural unit at the size preferred by our genome: the household and the tribe.

You are following your heart and the mysteries that the world leaves for you, be they elk tracks, the top of an unknown peak or a "blank" spot on the map. Your goal is to discover beauty and blend into the landscape. Along the way you sample the wild edible plants, gather your water from the creek or spring, shelter yourself under an ancient tree. When it rains you get wet and when the sun beats down you are hot.\n\nWhether it\'s one day or a week, by yourself or in a small group, on a good wilderness walkabout you are constantly faced with the unknown, both in the world around you and within. Where does this canyon go? Where will I sleep tonight? How will it be to not see anyone else for an entire day? What sort of tracks are these? Will I be able to start a fire in the pouring rain? You have left behind the known comforts of family, school, home, work, four walls and electricity in exchange for a chance to interact with Mystery for a time. The world around you becomes a metaphor for your internal landscape as you face your fear of a dark starless night and the unknown future that waits for you when you return.</blockquote>'

The U.S. chapter even has profiles of Powell and Ashcroft (and, of course, the profile of Cheney mentions nothing of his marksmanship).\n\nThe political analysis and history is single-minded and the humor dark, but that\'s to be expected from someone who has experienced all that RYP and his contributors have.

The real essence or wisdom occurs when one finally gives up trying to explain events in terms of "logic" and "reality". Many confusing aspects of existence can better be explained by actions of a multiplicity of spirits. Instead of a concept of a single god, there is an awareness of "that which we do not understand." In Lakota religion, for example, the term <em>Wakan Tanka</em> is often translated as "god." But a more proper translation, according to the medicine people who taught me, is "The Great Mystery."\n\nWhile rationality can explain much, there are limits to human capabilities of understanding. The English language is structured to account for cause and effect. For example, English speakers say, "It is raining," with the implication that there is a cause "it" that leads to rain. Many Indian languages, on the other hand, merely note what is most accurately translated as "raining" as an observable fact. Such an approach brings a freedom to stop worrying about causes of things, and merely to relax and accept that our human insights can go only so far. By not taking ourselves too seriously, or over inflating human importance, we can get beyond the logical world.\n\nThe emphasis of American Indian religions, then, is on the spiritual nature of all things. To understand the physical world, one must appreciate the underlying spiritual essence. Then one can begin to see that the physical is only a faint shadow, a partial reflection, of a supernatural and extrarational world. By the Indian view, everything that exists is spiritual. Every object -- plants, rocks, water, air, the moon, animals, humans, the earth itself -- has a spirit. The spirit of one thing (including a human) is not superior to the spirit of any other. Such a view promotes a sophisticated ecological awareness of the place that humans have in the larger environment. The function of religion is not to try to condemn or to change what exists, but to accept the realities of the world and to appreciate their contributions to life. Everything that exists has a purpose.</blockquote>\n- Walter L. Williams'

Since that time, I\'ve traveled the world and studied.  I\'ve seen how things are in other countries (compared to here in the USA) and learned a great deal about international relations (especially U.S. foreign policy) and American history (especially the U.S. Indian wars).  I know what it\'s like to feel the call of the guardian/warrior deep in one\'s heart -- this basic desire to serve your people is a good one, and should be respected.  I\'ve been following that calling in one form or another all my life, and \nI can see you are attempting to honor that same calling.  No matter what happens in Iraq, you have my personal respect, and I trust you will act as honorably as you can given the situation you are likely to find yourself in there. \n\nI\'m not going to bullshit you with sugar-coated words however, because I know (from personal experience) that when a man is making the decision to go and participate in killing his fellow man, that is a time for speaking the truth.  I want to be straight with you, because I think you deserve that much.  I think all soldiers deserve that much.  The situation in Iraq is not one where you will be given the opportunity to fight for my freedom (or anyone else\'s).  In Iraq, you will be required to kill people you do not know -- people you have no real understanding of, or personal grievance against.  People you cannot listen to or speak with, because you do not understand their language.  You will be killing these people in their homes and on their home soil, not ours.  Can you point to a single person you know of who has been killed here in America by an Iraqi?  In Iraq you will be killing people who can list for you the names of their own family members who have died in their own \nhomeland at the hands of Americans.  Do you know what that will mean for you?  And yet, you will be required to kill and/or participate in killing these people.  You will be forced to do this (even if your heart \ncries out against what you are doing, and most likely at some point, it will) because you will be taking orders from other men (ultimately politicians) with their own (political) agendas.  If eventually your heart grows sick of what you are doing and you refuse taking these orders, you will be punished, then jailed and sent home in disgrace.\n\nNo matter how the war goes for you, when you return to the U.S.A, what you have experienced in Iraq will put you at risk for a wide range of physical health problems (gulf war syndrome stuff, likely caused by exposure to depleted uranium munitions used by the U.S. military), mental illnesses (caused by post-traumatic stress) and you will be more likely to become an alcoholic, drug addict and/or domestic abuser (i.e. one who abuses his wife & kids) or to become homeless.  V.A. mental health and addictions counseling services are being overwhelmed as we speak by returning vets whose spirits are sick & suffering from that war.\n\nIf you go, you go for your own reasons -- and these reasons have nothing to do with my freedom.  I will not take part in helping to justify what you are about to do.  The freedom that I care about is my freedom to walk the Old Ways -- to heed the call of my heart and walk the simple & gentile path of my ancestors close to Mother Earth.  That freedom is found here, and the "fight" for it is here.  If you want to be a part of that, the struggle begins with you -- this is the real path of the guardian/warrior -- and it is here, not over in Iraq.\n\nI know what the U.S. government is fighting for over there, and it\'s pretty simple really.  There are no lofty ideals or complex conspiracies -- it\'s about oil wealth.  This war has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with the fact that oil (which makes some people rich & powerful beyond their most insane fantasies) is about to start running out on a worldwide scale.\n\nIf you go, my prayers go with you.  At the same time, I\'m not going to feed you any crap about what you are getting yourself into.  Also, when you get back, if you need some time to heal your spirit and explore who you truly are in close contact with the natural world, then my circle & I here at the Teaching Drum will be honored to serve you in that process.\n\n--Glenn\n\nP.S.

Involving shelter building, harvesting edible plants, navigation techniques and fire-making, this wander gives you the opportunity to experience nature in an ancient and meaningful way.</blockquote>'

The 3-Day Survival Walk-about is designed to allow people to touch nature in a pure and unmediated manner, to experience the freedom of walking across a landscape and trusting in the earth to provide for all of our needs.</p>\n<p>Participants will walk into the wilderness with only a knife and water purifiers, and we&#8217;ll learn and apply survival skills as the need for them arises. Involving shelter building, harvesting edible plants, navigation techniques and fire-making, this wander gives you the opportunity to experience nature in an ancient and meaningful way.</blockquote></p>'

The first deviation came when I discovered that I\'d be charged $15 p/ night just to park -- the same as what was charged to camp in a normal camp site. On top of that, there was self-registration available for normal camping, but not for the primitive camp (it was off-season, so the visitor\'s center was closed). So, I decided to camp at the normal site.\n\nI\'d also agreed to give Wade, my friend at the University of Oregon, a ride back to Seattle and, since we\'d be driving up the coast, his roommate, Jordon, a ride to Astoria, which meant I\'d have to be back in Eugene on Thursday.\n\n<b>Saturday</b>\nLeft home in the morning.\nI took i-5 down to Eugene, arriving early in the evening. After meeting up with Wade and some of his friends at the University of Oregon, we went to explore <a href="http://www.friendsofhendrickspark.org/" >Hendricks Park</a>.\nDinner at the Laughing Planet Cafe and dessert at <a href="http://www.sweetlifedesserts.com/" >Sweet Life</a>.\nI spent the night on a spare bed in the dorms.\n\n<b>Sunday</b>\nLeft Eugene early in the morning.\nI took OR-126 out to the coast, where I got on 101 and headed south. I entertained myself throughout the drive by stopping at lots of parks and scenic pull-offs.\n(I don\'t know why Bellingham is so renowned for biker gangs -- southern Oregon certainly has more.)\nI ended up reaching the California border as the sun was going down and decided to spend the night in a hotel in Crescent City, CA.\n\n<b>Monday</b>\nLeft Crescent City in the morning and drove about 20 miles south to <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=415" >Prairie Creek State Park</a>. After discovering that I\'d be spending my time in the Redwoods in a normal campsite, I decided to check out the site at the beach to see if I liked it better. The drive there started out simple enough -- another 5 minutes on 101. Then I reached the turn-off to the site and discovered a rather large puddle in my way -- deep enough that the water level was about halfway up my tires. Shortly after that, the pavement ended and the road turned into a dirt trail completely covered with pot-holes. It wasn\'t very fun to try to navigate, but I made it through. After finally reaching the beach, the road deteriorated even more (I didn\'t think it was possible). On top of the pot-holes doubling in size, there was a huge cliff to my right, which worried the Geologist inside of me. A few more minutes on that road and I reached the campsite, but decided that with the road, the cliff, and the wind, I preferred the camp site at the visitor\'s center. So I turned right around, navigated the horrible road, drove through the puddle, and went back to the first site. After paying and setting up camp, I wandered around the smaller trails near the camp for a little bit before the sun started going down.\nAfter that, I ate dinner with the Elk (who are so "dangerous" that they\'ll come right into your campsite to graze without paying you any mind), read a little in my book, and went to bed with the Sun.\nNot a bad Equinox.\n\n<b>Tuesday</b>\nWoke up with the sun.\nAfter having breakfast with the Quail, I threw some snacks and toilet paper in my camelbak and headed off for a day of exploration. I walked all around the park, exploring misty Forest. At one point I was stalked by what looked to be a Mountain Lion, but I never saw any bears -- perhaps they were still hibernating. I returned to the camp as the sun was going down, and had dinner. It was extremely painful to walk around camp that night, but I didn\'t end up with any blisters.\nWent to bed with the Sun.\n\n<b>Wednesday</b>\nWoke up with the sun.\nSince I had to be back in Eugene on Thursday, I decided I\'d make half of the journey today. After wandering around the shorter trails that I\'d explored Monday, I packed up the camp and got back on 101. I reached the site that I intended to stay at in the afternoon (a little south of Reedsport, OR). It didn\'t seem worth it to me to set up my tent for just one night, so I decided that I\'d sleep in the car that night. After paying the camp site fee, I ventured off to explore the sand dunes. Since I had no map of the area, all the dunes looked rather similar, and the wind was beginning to erase my tracks, I decided to cut that adventure short, but not without having a little fun.\nAfter arriving back at the camp, I snacked a bit and read my book. At one point, some lady came driving up to the site (I assume she must have been the camp host, a concept which I was only introduced to when I arrived at Prairie Creek). She rolled down her window and asked if I needed help. I said no. (I only ever realize this after the fact, but, for some reason, people always ask me if I need help when they\'re confused. I don\'t know why they can\'t just say what they mean -- they\'re obviously the ones that need help. I always take the question literally and reply no.) After that she asked if I knew that I was in a campsite -- that seemed rather insulting, but, since this was my first contact with civilization in a few days, I assumed that in her eyes I might somehow seem strange and just needed to adjust back to their ways. After a little more dancing around the subject, I realized what she wanted to know if I had paid or not. Why she couldn\'t just have asked that in the first place, I don\'t know. I pointed to the receipt that was pinned to the post at the entrance to the site, literally right in front of her. She drove off, and I went back to reading. As the sun went down, I got into my car and went to sleep, but woke up often and wasn\'t very comfortable -- sleeping in the car apparently isn\'t for me.\n\n<b>Thursday</b>\nWoke up with the sun and drove back to Eugene.\nWade had a final at 3pm, so we decided to leave Friday morning. We wandered around campus a bit, only to come back to the dorm and find that I\'d gotten a $20 ticket for parking in a permitted lot without a permit. I paid that, then drove over to his friend\'s house to avoid getting another ticket. After a couple hours hanging out there, two of the people wanted to go to a show in Portland, but I was blocking them in. So I went out to move my car, and discovered that I\'d locked the keys in the ignition -- something I\'ve never done before. (I think my car was getting back at me for sleeping in it.) The locksmith was quick and only cost $35, so it wasn\'t too bad. We hung out in the dorms that night, but I was still on Forest time, so I had to go to bed soon after the sun went down.\nSpent the night on a couch at one of Wade\'s friend\'s house.\n\n<b>Friday</b>\nWoke up a bit after the sun.\nI drove back to the dorms to get Wade and Jordon up. After they packed, we drove out to the coast and got back on 101 -- this time going North to Astoria, OR. We made good time, stopping only at the <span class="removed_link">Tillamook Cheese Factory</span> because Jordon said it was a law that if you drove through Tillamook, you had to stop (and I wanted ice cream). A few miles south of Astoria, we pulled off at a turn around and jumped the barrier. Jordon led us through the bush, out to a cliff he knew about with a view. We arrived in Astoria just as the sun went down. Jordon\'s parents took us out to dinner, and then we hung out at a friend\'s house.\n\n<b>Saturday</b>\nWe explored Astoria a bit more, then Wade and I got back on the road again. We headed north on 101 for a while, headed East to Olympia, then got back on i-5 and went home, arriving at about 7pm.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157602951042625/">Photos here</a>.'

Change how you feel and you change your experience of the world.</em>\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of <a href="http://www.navaching.com/hawkeen/hawktrain.html" >Hawkeen Training</a> is <a href="http://www.navaching.com/hawkeen/nwalk.html" >NightWalking</a>, a technique used to bring about heightened states of consciousness through vision.\n\nResearch into the technique began with trying to understand what it was that caused athletes to experience "flow" or "peak experience", the ability to "see the whole court."\n<blockquote>John Brodie, who was quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers some 25 years ago, has talked enthusiastically and knowledgeably about flow, perhaps encouraged by his friend, Michael Murphy, founder of Esalen Institute. He once recalled how in the midst of a game his level of play would suddenly jump to a higher plane. Though huge lineman crashed in on him, he was in perfect control as he calmly stepped back, set up, and threw. Brodie described how the football appeared to travel on a "wire of will" that connected him to his receiver, usually the peerless Gene Washington. He claimed that he had seen defensive backs cut in front of Washington to intercept the ball, but it had hopped over their fingertips and into the pass catcher\'s hands. It seemed inevitable that the play be completed.</blockquote>\nIt was soon discovered that the same technique was used in swordsmanship.\n<blockquote>In The Book of Five Rings, Miyamoto Musashi, the legendary swordsman of 16th century Japan, implies that he fought his greatest duels with his eyes crossed, and goes into considerable detail about developing and using this strange ability. He writes somewhat mysteriously about a state he entered while so engaged. He also refers to the two types of sight which he calls Ken and Kan. Ken registers the movements of surface phenomena; it\'s the observation of superficial appearance. Kan is the examination of the essence of things, seeing through or into. For Musashi, Ken is seeing with the eyes, Kan is seeing with the mind, a difference paralleling that between style and substance. He gives instructions for developing Kan sight: "It is important to observe both sides without moving the eyes. It is no good trying to learn this kind of thing in great haste. Always be watchful in this manner and under no circumstances alter your point of concentration."</blockquote>\nMoreover, it is utilized by Tibetan Lung-gom-pas (spiritual walkers).\n<blockquote>The walker must neither speak, nor look from side to side. He must keep his eyes fixed on a single distant object and never allow his attention to be attracted by anything else. When the trance has been reached, though normal consciousness is for the greater part suppressed, it remains sufficiently alive to keep the man aware of the obstacles in his way, and mindful of his direction and goal.\n\nAny clear night is deemed good for the training of beginners, but strong starlight is especially favorable. One is often advised to keep the eyes fixed on a particular star. This appears connected with hypnotic effects, and we have been told that among novices who train themselves in that way, some stop walking when "their" star sinks below the skyline or rises above their head. Others, on the contrary, do not notice its disappearance because by the time that the star has passed out of sight, they have formed a subjective image of it which remains fixed before them.\n\nSome initiates in the secret lore also assert that, as a result of long years of practice, after he has travelled over a certain distance, the feet of the lung-gom-pa no longer touch the ground, and that he glides on the air with an extreme celerity.</blockquote>\nNot to be outdone, it is also utilized by <a href="http://www.csd.net/~bfaigao/full-circle/apache.html" >Apache stalkers</a> (they called it Owl Vision).\n\nNightWalking is based upon these basic aspects of vision:\n<blockquote>\n- Cones have a one-to-one correlation with nerve fibers while many rods may connect a single nerve fiber.\n- Cones are sensitive to color while rods primarily register the intensity of light.\n- Rods are much more sensitive to light than cones.\n- Rods are much more sensitive to the detection of movement than cones.\n- The cones and rods are parts of separate neurological systems and are processed separately. In fact, there is much speculation on just where information from these two systems intersects in the brain.</blockquote>\n\nThe idea is, you have two separate vision systems: central (cones) and peripheral (rods). By focusing your eyes on a fixed point in front of you and not moving them, you can, in effect, shut down your central vision system. \nThough it may seem that by doing this you\'re actually hindering your senses, it\'s proposed that by "seeing with your mind", you are able to see more, yet with fewer distractions. Doing this while walking, one is able to see and manuever around all obstacles -- without even thinking about it.\nIn the dark, your cones are rarely used at all. Thus, walking at night extends the separation between rods and cones. NightWalking.\n<blockquote>Not only were we learning to travel freely in the dark; it was becoming apparent that this capability connected us more directly to a nonconscious part of our brains that seems devoted to our safety and general security. Far from being a storehouse of fear, we found the nonconscious--or at least the aspect of it that is accessed through the state of peripheral awareness--to be a trustworthy protector that not only leads us around rocks, away from cliffs and back to the truck, but perhaps also serves as a guide to some natural state, to some most basic part of ourselves. In the peripheral state we felt comfortable, alert, relaxed, open, happy and very alive. Feelings of fear, anger, worry, doubt, and lust seem antithetical to the state, as if the neural wiring, whatever it is, for these such strong emotions, is bypassed. Benign accurately describes the feeling of NightWalking.</blockquote>\n\nBy switching to peripheral vision, all other senses switch to peripheral as well, bringing about a state of peripheral awareness. As described by Tony Hiss:\n<blockquote>We can experience any place because we\'ve all received, as part of the structure of our attention, a mechanism that drinks in whatever it can from our surroundings. This underlying awareness--we call it simultaneous perception--seems to operate continuously, at least during waking hours, even when our concentration seems altogether engrossed in something else entirely. While normal waking consciousness works to simplify perception, allowing us to act quickly and flexibly by helping us remain seemingly oblivious to almost everything except the task in front of us, simultaneous perception is more like an extra, or a sixth, sense: it broadens and diffuses the beam of attention evenhandedly across all the senses so we can take in whatever is around us--which means sensations of touch and balance, for instance, in addition to all sights, sounds, and smells.\n\nAnytime we make conscious use of simultaneous perception, we can add on to our thinking. "One sees both close up and for miles, with the focus equal everywhere," as art critic Robert Hughes has said of landscape drawings by nineteenth-century German Romantic painters. With the help of this extra sense, the familiar hard-and-fast boundary between ourselves and our surroundings seems softened, expanding our sense of the space occupied by "here" and the time taken up by "now," and uncovering normally ignored patterns of relationships that make us part of larger groups and events. It\'s simultaneous perception that allows any of us a direct sense of continuing membership in our communities, and our regions, and the fellowship of all living creatures . . . .</blockquote>\n\n"The whole secret to mastering peripheral awareness is keeping one\'s visual attention independent from focused vision."\n\nNightWalking successfully brings one <a href="http://www.navaching.com/hawkeen/pmap.html" >from water to air</a>, bringing about a "pronounced calm".\n<blockquote>Walking while relying on peripheral vision requires that the conscious mind trust the nonconscious, and this inter-mind trust might be the essence of relaxation itself.</blockquote>\n\nPerhaps unbeknownst to us, this is a state we all enter at some point. I often find myself "zoning out" in order to concentrate. Though my vision is no longer focused, I feel my sense elevated in this non-ordinary state of reality.'

Also known as caapi, hoasca, yag&eacute;, nat&eacute;ma, mihi, kahi, pinde, and dapa, the brew is made of the bark of the vine Banisteriopsis caapi (which itself is also known as Ayahuasca) and (most commonly) the leaves of Psychotria viridis. Psychotria viridis is what contains the dimethyltryptamine (DMT), making the mixture hallucinogenic, but the DMT, when consumed orally, is made inactive by monamine oxidase (MOA). Thus the bark of the Banisteriopsis caapi is used for its MOA inhibiting property, allowing the DMT to take its course.\nMost interestingly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:DMT.png" >DMT</a> is almost identical in structure to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Serotonin.png" >Serotonin</a>, a neurotransmitter produced throughout the brain and responsible for "higher functions of behavior, such as planning and other time-related events." Serotonin is eventually deactived by the same thing that deactives DMT, MOA. So, one could consume only the bark of the Ayahuasca vine (or any other MOA inhibiter) and receive a similar psychoactive active to that produced by DMT. (Apparently some antidepressants take this route.)\nTerence McKenna, in many of his recordings, fondly referred to the Ayahuasca brew as "brain soup", since nothing in it is not naturally in your body.\n\nAs another interesting aside, there is DMT in your body right now (the human body naturally produces it), yet, in the United States, it is illegal to possess without a DEA license.

We made cold process soap with palm oil, coconut oil, and olive pomace oil. One batch we put in lavender, the other peppermint. Right now, the soap looks like this:\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/1865593389/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2022/1865593389_46ae55d39d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="00001" /></a>\n\nIn 48 hours it will harden and I\'ll take it out of the mold (paper cup). Then, in 30 days, the lye will have completed mixing with the oils and I\'ll have soap.\n\nHere are the recipes <a href="http://goodnaturedearthling.com/" >Suzanne</a> gave us:\n<blockquote><b><i>Cold Process Soap</i></b>\n<b>Materials:</b>\n-Stainless steel pot (8-12 qt, no aluminum)\n-Scale (measuring in ounces preferred)\n-Glass jar (gallon size -- check for cracks before use) or 4-8qt stainless steel pot\n-Wooden spoon (used for soap only)\n-Soap molds - no aluminum, cast iron, or teflon\n-Soap base oils, lye, water, herbs, spices, essential oils.\n\n<b>Directions</b>\n-Measure lye and place into glass jar or small stainless steel pot. Add cold water and stir until lye is dissolved. You may choose to wear eye protection and rubber gloves. The water will get very hot (180F). Be careful of the rising steam, as it is caustic and irritating to the throat and lungs. Set aside to cool to room temperature (may put container in tub of cold water).\n-Melt oils together on high heat in stainless steel pot. Remove from heat (do not let smoke), set aside to cool to room temperature (may put pot in tub of cold water).\n-Pour lye solution slowly into oils when the lye solution and fats are room temperature.\n-Stir constantly until mixture is thick and creamy with a "pea soup" consistency: approx 15-20 minutes\n-Stir in essential oils (1/2~1 1/2 oz) and dried herbs and spices with the amounts to your preference.\n-Pour into molds.\n-Cover and keep warm. Place in a draft free warm area for 48 hours.\n-Remove the soap from the molds. If there is any difficulty removing the soap from the molds, place them in your freezer for 24 hours. Run warm water over the bottom of the molds, the soap will slide out easily.\n-Cut and let cure in the open air for 30 days.\n\n<b>2 Basic Soap Recipes</b>\n<i>Recipe #1</i>\n40 oz. Palm Oil\n25 oz. Coconut Oil\n20 oz. Olive Pomace Oil\n32 oz. Cold Water\n10 1/2 oz. Lye\n\n<i>Recipe #2</i>\n40 oz. Coconut Oil\n45 oz. Olive Pomace Oil\n32 oz. Cold Water\n10 1/2 oz. Lye</blockquote>\n\nThe above is for cold process soap. Hot process soap -- which we didn\'t make in my class today -- takes a little more effort up front, but is usable in a few hours, instead of 30 days. \n\nThe recipes will make about 25 bars of soap. \n\nIt\'s important that you acquire Olive Pomace Oil -- not just Olive Oil or Pomace Oil. This is the third pressing of the olive.\n\nSuzanne, my instructor, uses an oak mold which she first lines with parchment paper.\n\nLye, contrary to Fight Club, will not burn you. It dries your skin, which will cause itching. Simply rinse it off with water and pat dry. '

Then, in 30 days, the lye will have completed mixing with the oils and I&#8217;ll have soap.</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes <a href="http://goodnaturedearthling.com/">Suzanne</a> gave us:\n<blockquote><b><i>Cold Process Soap</i></b>\n<b>Materials:</b>\n-Stainless steel pot (8-12 qt, no aluminum)\n-Scale (measuring in ounces preferred)\n-Glass jar (gallon size &#8212; check for cracks before use) or 4-8qt stainless steel pot\n-Wooden spoon (used for soap only)\n-Soap molds - no aluminum, cast iron, or teflon\n-Soap base oils, lye, water, herbs, spices, essential oils.</p>\n<p><b>Directions</b>\n-Measure lye and place into glass jar or small stainless steel pot. Add cold water and stir until lye is dissolved. You may choose to wear eye protection and rubber gloves. The water will get very hot (180F). Be careful of the rising steam, as it is caustic and irritating to the throat and lungs. Set aside to cool to room temperature (may put container in tub of cold water).\n-Melt oils together on high heat in stainless steel pot. Remove from heat (do not let smoke), set aside to cool to room temperature (may put pot in tub of cold water).\n-Pour lye solution slowly into oils when the lye solution and fats are room temperature.\n-Stir constantly until mixture is thick and creamy with a &#8220;pea soup&#8221; consistency: approx 15-20 minutes\n-Stir in essential oils (1/2~1 1/2 oz) and dried herbs and spices with the amounts to your preference.\n-Pour into molds.\n-Cover and keep warm. Place in a draft free warm area for 48 hours.\n-Remove the soap from the molds. If there is any difficulty removing the soap from the molds, place them in your freezer for 24 hours. Run warm water over the bottom of the molds, the soap will slide out easily.\n-Cut and let cure in the open air for 30 days.</p>\n<p><b>2 Basic Soap Recipes</b>\n<i>Recipe #1</i>\n40 oz. Palm Oil\n25 oz. Coconut Oil\n20 oz. Olive Pomace Oil\n32 oz. Cold Water\n10 1/2 oz. Lye</p>\n<p><i>Recipe #2</i>\n40 oz. Coconut Oil\n45 oz. Olive Pomace Oil\n32 oz. Cold Water\n10 1/2 oz. Lye</blockquote></p>\n<p>The above is for cold process soap. Hot process soap &#8212; which we didn&#8217;t make in my class today &#8212; takes a little more effort up front, but is usable in a few hours, instead of 30 days. </p>\n<p>The recipes will make about 25 bars of soap. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important that you acquire Olive Pomace Oil &#8212; not just Olive Oil or Pomace Oil. This is the third pressing of the olive.</p>\n<p>Suzanne, my instructor, uses an oak mold which she first lines with parchment paper.</p>\n<p>Lye, contrary to Fight Club, will not burn you. It dries your skin, which will cause itching. Simply rinse it off with water and pat dry. </p>'

Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves.

    vellum_post_529.body = u'<blockquote>By Dr. Lawrence Britt\n\nDr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:\n \n1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n \n2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n \n3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n \n4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread\ndomestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n \n5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n \n6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n \n7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n \n8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government\'s policies or actions.\n \n9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n \n10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n \n11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n \n12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n \n13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n \n14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</blockquote>'

Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government&#8217;s policies or actions.\n\n9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</blockquote>'

And yet one of the groups with the poorest survival rates is children ages seven to twelve. Clearly, those youngest children have a deep secret that trumps knowledge and experience.\n\nScientists do not know exactly what that secret is, but the answer may lie in basic childhood traits. At that age, the brain has not yet developed certain abilities. For example, small children do not create the same sort of mental maps adults do. They don\'t understand traveling to a particular place, so they don\'t run to get somewhere beyond their field of vision. They also follow their instincts. If it gets cold, they crawl into a hollow tree to get warm. If they\'re tired, they rest, so they don\'t get fatigued. If they\'re thirsty, they drink. They try to make themselves comfortable and staying comfortable helps keep them alive... The secret may also lie in the fact that they do not yet have the sophisticated mental mapping ability that adults have, and so do not try to bend the map. They remap the world they\'re in.\n\nChildren between the ages of seven and twelve, on the other hand, have some adult characteristics, such as mental mapping, but they don\'t have adult judgment. They don\'t ordinarily have the strong ability to control emotional responses and to reason through their situation. They panic and run. They look for shortcuts. If a trail peters out, they keep going, ignoring thirst, hunger, and cold, until they fall over. In learning to think more like adults, it seems, they have suppressed the very instincts that might have helped them.</blockquote>\n-Laurence Gonzales, <a href="http://www.pig-monkey.com/2006/01/27/deep-survival-who-lives-who-dies-and-why/" >Deep Survival</a>, pg 170\n\n<blockquote>In the beginner\'s mind there are many possibilities.

It has dire implications for freedom of association and First Amendment rights.\nWe can take for granted that the new federal police will be used to suppress dissent and to break up opposition. The Brownshirts are now arming themselves with a Gestapo.\n\nMany naive Americans will write to me to explain that this new provision in the reauthorization of the "Patriot Act" is necessary to protect the president and other high officials from terrorists or from harm at the hands of angry demonstrators: "No one else will have anything to fear." Some will accuse me of being an alarmist, and others will say that it is unpatriotic to doubt the law\'s good intentions.\n\nAmericans will write such nonsense despite the fact that the president and foreign dignitaries are already provided superb protection by the Secret Service.

Chomsky discusses our current one party system, the war on terror, and the current administration\'s policies.\n<blockquote>They\'re not stupid. They know that they\'re increasing the threat of a serious catastrophe. But that\'s a generation or two away. Who cares? There\'s basically two principles that define the Bush administration policies: stuff the pockets of your rich friends with dollars, and increase your control over the world. Almost everything follows from that. If you happen to blow up the world, well, you know, it\'s somebody else\'s business. Stuff happens, as Rumsfeld said.</blockquote>\n\nOver at The Alternative Press Review, there\'s a <span class="removed_link">transcript of Chomsky\'s lecture, "War on Terror"</span>.\n\n\n<blockquote>To take one of these official definitions, terrorism is "the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature...through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear," typically targeting civilians. The British government\'s definition is about the same: "Terrorism is the use, or threat, of action which is violent, damaging or disrupting, and is intended to influence the government or intimidate the public and is for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause." These definitions seem fairly clear and close to ordinary usage. There also seems to be general agreement that they are appropriate when discussing the terrorism of enemies.\n\nBut a problem at once arises. These definitions yield an entirely unacceptable consequence: it follows that the US is a leading terrorist state...\n\n...\n\nWhat about the boundary between terror and resistance? One question that arises is the legitimacy of actions to realize "the right to self-determination, freedom, and independence, as derived from the Charter of the United Nations, of people forcibly deprived of that right..., particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation..." Do such actions fall under terror or resistance?\n\n...\n\nThere are other such examples. We might want to bear them in mind when we read Bush II\'s impassioned pronouncement that "the United States makes no distinction between those who commit acts of terror and those who support them, because they\'re equally as guilty of murder," and "the civilized world must hold those regimes to account." This was proclaimed to great applause at the National Endowment for Democracy, a few days after Venezuela\'s extradition request had been refused. Bush\'s remarks pose another dilemma. Either the US is part of the civilized world, and must send the US air force to bomb Washington; or it declares itself to be outside the civilized world. The logic is impeccable, but fortunately, logic has been dispatched as deep into the memory hole as moral truisms.</blockquote>'

If marching in a protest will do it, I will walk as far as you want. If holding a candle will do it, I will hold two.

If voting will do it, I will vote.\n\nBut all those things are allowed by those in power. And none of those things will ever stop those in power from killing Indian children. They never have and they never will. Given that my people\'s children are being killed, you have no grounds to complain at whatever means I use to protect the lives of my people\'s children.

Initially, I agreed with Vavrek about there being no absolute truth -- that it\'s all subjective reality. I have no reason to think that my idea of freedom or any of my ideals are any more correct than anyone else\'s (Contradiction? The reason I\'m against sean\'s new path is because I feel that my ideal of not forcing others into my culture is somehow superior than his ideal of forcing his version of freedom). This is the same justification I have against violence. What right do I have to say that another man should die -- or be locked away in a nut house -- because he thinks or acts differently than I? Yet now, I do think there is some kind of Truth out there. I think we all agree on the same utopian ideal of a peaceful, sustainable, comfortable existence.\n\nVavrek "still maintain[ed] that truth is inseperable from a point of view. Everything is connected." He continued, saying "the great mistake of our recent past was the imaginary division of all things into individual parts. It came with the invention of the clock, thinking that everything works in seperate gears and wheels. On the surface,  it just might seem this way. You can\'t see anything without the seer." He disagreed with my idea that we all have the same end in mind.\n\nBringing this back to the ends or the means, I continued my train of thought on Sean\'s statement.\n\nI disagree with Sean in that I no longer believe that the ends justifies the means. The path you take to this ideal is equally, if not more so, important as the end, because the end is just that -- an IDEAL. As such, I believe it\'s unattainable. We\'ll not reach it in this lifetime, nor in one hundred. You can kill people for the Truth all you want, but, at the end of the day when you\'ve not attained the unattainable, what have you done? Killed people. For nothing.\n\nWith this, Vavrek agreed.\n\nAfter listening to Derrick\'s interview, I\'m rethinking it all over again. \n\nIt\'s obiovus that his idea of the end is more practical and reality based than my abstract concept.

    vellum_post_548.body = u'<blockquote>If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.\n\nHuman history represents such a radical break with the natural systems of biological organization that preceded it, that it must be the response to a kind of attractor, or dwell point that lies ahead in the temporal dimension. Persistently Western religions have integrated into their theologies the notion of a kind of end of the world, and I think that a lot of psychedelic experimentation sort of confirms this intuition, I mean, it isn\'t going to happen according to any of the scenarios of orthodox religion, but the basic intuition, that the universe seeks closure in a kind of omega point of transcendence, is confirmed, it\'s almost as though this object in hyperspace, glittering in hyperspace, throws off reflections of itself, which actually ricochet into the past, illuminating this mystic, inspiring that saint or visionary, and that out of these fragmentary glimpses of eternity we can build a kind of map, of not only the past of the universe, and the evolutionary egression into novelty, but a kind of map of the future, this is what shamanism is always been about, a shaman is someone who has been to the end, it\'s someone who knows how the world really works, and knowing how the world really works means to have risen outside, above, beyond the dimensions of ordinary space, time, and casuistry, and actually seen the wiring under the board, stepped outside the confines of learned culture and learned and embedded language, into the domain of what Wittgenstein called "the unspeakable," the transcendental presence of the other, which can be absanctioned, in various ways, to yield systems of knowledge which can be brought back into ordinary social space for the good of the community, so in the context of ninety percent of human culture, the shaman has been the agent of evolution, because the shaman learns the techniques to go between ordinary reality and the domain of the ideas, this higher dimensional continuum that is somehow parallel to us, available to us, and yet ordinarily occluded by cultural convention out of fear of the mystery I believe, and what shamans are, I believe, are people who have been able to de-condition themselves from the community\'s instinctual distrust of the mystery, and to go into it, to go into this bewildering higher dimension, and gain knowledge, recover the jewel lost at the beginning of time, to save souls, cure, commune with the ancestors and so forth and so on. Shamanism is not a religion, it\'s a set of techniques, and the principal technique is the use of psychedelic plants. What psychedelics do is they dissolve boundaries, and in the presence of dissolved boundaries, one cannot continue to close one\'s eyes to the ruination of the earth, the poisoning of the seas, and the consequences of two thousand years of unchallenged dominator culture, based on monotheism, hatred of nature, suppression of the female, and so forth and so on. So, what shamans have to do is act as exemplars, by making this cosmic journey to the domain of the Gaian ideas, and then bringing them back in the form of art to the struggle to save the world. The planet has a kind of intelligence, that it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being. The message that nature sends is, transform your language through a synergy between electronic culture and the psychedelic imagination, a synergy between dance and idea, a synergy between understanding and intuition, and dissolve the boundaries that your culture has sanctioned between you, to become part of this Gaian supermind, I mean I think it\'s fairly profound, it\'s fairly apocalyptic.

    vellum_post_548.body_rendered = u'<blockquote>If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.\n\nHuman history represents such a radical break with the natural systems of biological organization that preceded it, that it must be the response to a kind of attractor, or dwell point that lies ahead in the temporal dimension. Persistently Western religions have integrated into their theologies the notion of a kind of end of the world, and I think that a lot of psychedelic experimentation sort of confirms this intuition, I mean, it isn&#8217;t going to happen according to any of the scenarios of orthodox religion, but the basic intuition, that the universe seeks closure in a kind of omega point of transcendence, is confirmed, it&#8217;s almost as though this object in hyperspace, glittering in hyperspace, throws off reflections of itself, which actually ricochet into the past, illuminating this mystic, inspiring that saint or visionary, and that out of these fragmentary glimpses of eternity we can build a kind of map, of not only the past of the universe, and the evolutionary egression into novelty, but a kind of map of the future, this is what shamanism is always been about, a shaman is someone who has been to the end, it&#8217;s someone who knows how the world really works, and knowing how the world really works means to have risen outside, above, beyond the dimensions of ordinary space, time, and casuistry, and actually seen the wiring under the board, stepped outside the confines of learned culture and learned and embedded language, into the domain of what Wittgenstein called &#8220;the unspeakable,&#8221; the transcendental presence of the other, which can be absanctioned, in various ways, to yield systems of knowledge which can be brought back into ordinary social space for the good of the community, so in the context of ninety percent of human culture, the shaman has been the agent of evolution, because the shaman learns the techniques to go between ordinary reality and the domain of the ideas, this higher dimensional continuum that is somehow parallel to us, available to us, and yet ordinarily occluded by cultural convention out of fear of the mystery I believe, and what shamans are, I believe, are people who have been able to de-condition themselves from the community&#8217;s instinctual distrust of the mystery, and to go into it, to go into this bewildering higher dimension, and gain knowledge, recover the jewel lost at the beginning of time, to save souls, cure, commune with the ancestors and so forth and so on. Shamanism is not a religion, it&#8217;s a set of techniques, and the principal technique is the use of psychedelic plants. What psychedelics do is they dissolve boundaries, and in the presence of dissolved boundaries, one cannot continue to close one&#8217;s eyes to the ruination of the earth, the poisoning of the seas, and the consequences of two thousand years of unchallenged dominator culture, based on monotheism, hatred of nature, suppression of the female, and so forth and so on. So, what shamans have to do is act as exemplars, by making this cosmic journey to the domain of the Gaian ideas, and then bringing them back in the form of art to the struggle to save the world. The planet has a kind of intelligence, that it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being. The message that nature sends is, transform your language through a synergy between electronic culture and the psychedelic imagination, a synergy between dance and idea, a synergy between understanding and intuition, and dissolve the boundaries that your culture has sanctioned between you, to become part of this Gaian supermind, I mean I think it&#8217;s fairly profound, it&#8217;s fairly apocalyptic. History is ending. I mean, we are to be the generation that witnesses the revelation of the purpose of the cosmos. History is the shock wave of the eschaton. History is the shock wave of eschatology, and what this means for those of us who will live through this transition into hyperspace, is that we will be privileged to see the greatest release of compressed change probably since the birth of the universe.

Jury deliberations are expected to resume this morning.\n\nGiven the secretive nature of the nation\'s largest intelligence\nagency, the trial has provided a rare look inside NSA\'s Anne Arundel\nCounty complex at Fort Meade.\n\nEvidence showed surveillance cameras that didn\'t record, a lack of\nsecurity guards and a policy of less-than-routine searches of\nemployees\' cars. The accused, a former Secret Service agent who once\nguarded the White House, was reported by a woman he met on an Internet\ndating site who turned out to have an extensive criminal record.\n\nNSA is one of the state\'s largest employers, with an estimated work\nforce of 15,000 people.

Ford worked for the agency for more\nthan two years, but the exact nature of his job was not revealed\nyesterday.\n\nBut two weeks of testimony in open court has shed some light on some\nalleged gaps in NSA security procedures.\n\nAt least one witness testified there were no security guards at the\n"tech" building where Ford is accused of removing the classified\ndocuments, according to federal prosecutors.

    vellum_post_602.body = u'I\'ve been <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/" >here</a> for over a week now and I\'ve yet to discuss the network. Surprising.\n\nWhen you first plug into the network, the DHCP server (66.165.10.35) gives you a 10.242.*.* IP. This is for unregistered or quarantined computers (if someone is spreading a virus to all the poor Windows users, they\'d be bumped to this network, which has no internet access and limited network access).\n\nOpening up a web browser will take you the <span class="removed_link">registration page</span>, which basically just asks for your name and student number, throws that into a database with your MAC address, and gives you a 66.165.*.* IP, a registered address. (It should be mentioned that this is a public IP -- "a few ports are filtered" but I don\'t know which.) Windows users, though, have an extra step (so don\'t spoof your user agent when trying to register). They have to download the <span class="removed_link">ResTek Security Detector</span> (not based on <span class="removed_link">NetReg</span>), which checks to make sure you have all the latest Windows updates and an updated virus scanner (it doesn\'t actually scan your computer for viruses). If you lack either of these things, the proxy server (webproxy.restek.wwu.edu) will allow connections to certain addresses such as Microsoft, McAfee <a href="http://west.wwu.edu/atus/helpdesk/" >and the like</a> (I smell a security hole), so that you can get the latest updates on your 10.242.*.* computer. The school will also provide you with a free copy of McAfee Anti-virus, if you\'re lacking.\n\nStudents who wish to use dialup can dial extension 5255 from their modems and enter their Novell username (the scheme for the username -- which is the same as the name for the @cc.wwu.edu email the school gives out -- is in the form of lastnamefirstinitial. I think if you have a long last name it is only the first six letters of your last name. I don\'t know if first initial is included in that case) and password. This is the same username and password students use for their email, <a href="http://portal.cc.wwu.edu/mywestern/render.userLayoutRootNode.uP" >myWestern</a>, blackboard, lab computers, etc.\nI assume students can access the dialup off-campus, but I don\'t know what the full phone number is. Most numbers here seem to be 360-788* or 360-650*. Somebody should do a scan.\n\nEach student is allowed "as many IPs as you need", but only one per MAC address. Unused IPs are eventually unregistered. You are allowed to run an access point or router in your room, simply spoof your already registered MAC.\n\nDuring your normal online browsing, you are encouraged to use the proxy server (running <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" >Squid</a>), which does no filtering, but caches data so that others can retrieve it quicker. This is done through an algorithm called Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging (LFUD), which "keeps popular objects in cache regardless of their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate (file size) at the expense of target hit rate" (more info <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/1999/HPL-1999-69.ps" >here</a>). The caching, of course, implies that they have the capability to log -- and do probably log quite a bit. But the sheer amount of traffic must make it impossible to log everything, or even start to filter through that which they do log. (They <a href="http://www.restek.wwu.edu/network/network-overview/proxy" >claim</a> that "the content accessed by individual users is not monitored.") Port scans and other questionable data probably go unnoticed. High bandwidth traffic -- such as me downloading 10gb at 1505.97kb/s -- might set off a few flags. <span class="removed_link">Public</span> and <a href="http://restek.wwu.edu/mystats" >private</a> statistics are available to view your daily, weekly, and monthly bandwidth consumption and bandwidth usage for the residence halls and the entire campus.\n\nThere\'s another range of addresses I haven\'t mentioned, which is the academic network. I believe they\'re 140.160.*.*. I think these addresses are also given out to those connecting via the wireless, but I\'ve yet to try that out (it\'s either the 140 or 66.168.*.*). Apparently the main difference between the academic network and the normal 66.165.*.* is that the academic is more heavily monitored.\n\nAs far as bandwidth goes, there are no caps. Everybody has full access to the 28mbit pipe (this is lowered down to 3mbit during the summer), but bandwidth <a href="http://www.restek.wwu.edu/network/network-overview/bandwidth-prioritization/" >prioritization</a> does occur via <a href="http://www.bluecoat.com/">Packeteer</a>. This is the most interesting part of the network. Peer2peer traffic, instead of being outright banned, receives the lowest priority, making it a rare thing to see more than 4kb/s. This is understandable since p2p does take up a lot of bandwidth and the school wants to discourage students from committing copyright infringement, but it\'s also really annoying -- it makes it impossible to download the latest linux iso torrents and the like (yes, there are legitimate uses for p2p). Changing the port of your p2p server won\'t subvert the system, as Packeteer actually analyzes the traffic. Proxying the traffic through something like Tor may work, but that\'s really cruel to the Tor network and, as Tor is rather low latency itself, you won\'t see much improvement in speed. The easiest solution is to simply tunnel your p2p connection through ssh to an off-campus computer, but this obviously isn\'t very feasible for most students. I\'ve yet to come with any other ways to get around the prioritization. Any ideas?\n\nAnother interesting note: there\'s a whole lot of <a href="http://www.famatech.com/" >RAdmin</a> traffic on the lan (port 4899).\n\nHere\'s the output of a traceroute from the campus network to this site:\n<blockquote> 1:  student-x-xx.na.reshall.wwu.edu (66.165.x.xx)\n 1:  gw-2-1.na.reshall.wwu.edu (66.165.2.1)\n 2:  bh-f-a.restek.wwu.edu (66.165.31.245)\n 3:  core1-411.bellingham.fibercloud.net (216.57.208.173)\n 4:  brdr1-gig100.bellingham.fibercloud.net (216.57.207.49)\n 5:  12.124.173.17 (12.124.173.17)\n 6:  gbr1-p60.st6wa.ip.att.net (12.123.44.114)\n 7:  tbr1-p012501.st6wa.ip.att.net (12.122.12.157)\n 8:  12.123.44.177 (12.123.44.177)\n 9:  208.50.134.33 (208.50.134.33)\n10:  so2-1-0-622M.ar1.LAX3.gblx.net (67.17.64.45)\n11:  GE1-GX.dreamhost.com (67.17.162.162)\n12:  basic-ogle.lilac.dreamhost.com (66.33.199.37)</blockquote>\n\nHere\'s the output from an nslookup done on my public IP:\n<blockquote>Server:         66.165.10.35\nAddress:        66.165.10.35#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\n65.2.165.66.in-addr.arpa        name = student-x-xx.na.reshall.wwu.edu.\n\nAuthoritative answers can be found from:\n2.165.66.in-addr.arpa   nameserver = viking.wwu.edu.\n2.165.66.in-addr.arpa   nameserver = kulshan.restek.wwu.edu.\n2.165.66.in-addr.arpa   nameserver = henson.cc.wwu.edu.\nhenson.cc.wwu.edu       internet address = 140.160.240.12\nviking.wwu.edu  internet address = 140.160.242.13\nkulshan.restek.wwu.edu  internet address = 66.165.10.24</blockquote>\n\nHere\'s the output of a whois (done from <a href="http://network-tools.com/">nwtools</a>) on my public IP:\n<blockquote>This Registry database contains ONLY .EDU domains. \nThe data in the EDUCAUSE Whois database is provided \nby EDUCAUSE for information purposes in order to \nassist in the process of obtaining information about \nor related to .edu domain registration records. \n\nThe EDUCAUSE Whois database is authoritative for the \n.EDU domain.         \n\nA Web interface for the .EDU EDUCAUSE Whois Server is \navailable at: http://whois.educause.net \n\nBy submitting a Whois query, you agree that this information \nwill not be used to allow, enable, or otherwise support \nthe transmission of unsolicited commercial advertising or \nsolicitations via e-mail.\n\nYou may use "%" as a wildcard in your search.

During the day, we hung out in the shade with our neighbors Jeremy and Dale, who were coffee camp. Most everyone stopped by at one point or another for coffee, so we met a lot of people.\n\nMy favorite performance of the whole festival was the <a href="http://www.hobogoblins.com/carnival-main-page/entrance.htm" >999 Eyes of Endless Dreams Carnival Sideshow of the Damned</a>. Tina and I saw them three nights in a row.\n\nAs far as music, there wasn\'t really a schedule, so I have no idea who I was seeing and who I liked. I can say that the Combustion stage (mostly psytrance) and the Ambient Room (who\'s geo-dome Tina and I setup) were my favorite places. Dragontech was good, too.\n\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157602948340255/">Pictures are up here</a>. I didn\'t take a lot, since during the night it was too dark and I think flashes ruin the vibe. There is a bit of video, though.\nIt\'s all PG.

Most everyone stopped by at one point or another for coffee, so we met a lot of people.</p>\n<p>My favorite performance of the whole festival was the <a href="http://www.hobogoblins.com/carnival-main-page/entrance.htm">999 Eyes of Endless Dreams Carnival Sideshow of the Damned</a>. Tina and I saw them three nights in a row.</p>\n<p>As far as music, there wasn&#8217;t really a schedule, so I have no idea who I was seeing and who I liked. I can say that the Combustion stage (mostly psytrance) and the Ambient Room (who&#8217;s geo-dome Tina and I setup) were my favorite places. Dragontech was good, too.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigmonkey/sets/72157602948340255/">Pictures are up here</a>.

Most of you have likely heard about the national and\ninternational acts; Eat Static, Cosmosis, Tipper, Chris Carter and Nick\nTaylor. Without a doubt with these folks present, the stages are going to\nerupt on a nightly basis. \n\nHowever, that is not all. The local representation this year is\nunparalleled, never in the festival's 5 year history has there been so much\nNorthwest diversity and skill gracing the various stages. Some of the live\nacts and DJs you can expect to see are: KJ Sawka, Reggie Watts & all his\nhomies, Surrounded By Ninjas, Solovox, Auditory Sculpture, Marmalade,\nBumblebee, Variform, Dahlia, AtoMikDoG v.S. novaTRON, Miss Solar System,\nHoly Sons, King David, Grails, pr0teus, Specs One, Synth Club, Mandii, Try\nMy Cabbage, Jerry Abstract, Muschi, Lara, DJ Advent, Eddie, Osiris and so\nmany more. The list is phenomenally long and reads like a who's who in the\nburgeoning NW music scene. \n\nTo see it for yourself checkout: www.phoenixfest.com/performance.html.\n\nSTAGES:\nThough we would love to take credit for such a stellar lineup, it really is\nthe stages who are responsible for putting together such an amazing roster\nof talent. Speaking of the stages, each one has its own theme and direction\nprogrammed and dialed in practically to perfection...\n\nThe stages are:\n\nCOMBUSTION - The Phoenix Festival simply would not be what it is without\nproper representation from the NW Psytrance community. The stage this year\nis going to take things to new heights, featuring performances from Eat\nStatic and Cosmosis, this area is going to knock your psychedelic spandex\ntrousers clean off.\n\nDRAGONTECH INC - The Breaks stage is back! These kids are coming out again\nin full force to kill it with the sickest breaks from a keen selection of\nlocals and a couple of headliners.\n\nUPTOWN - This stage will have a foundation in hip-hop and turntablism. The\nmusic genres will consist of down-tempo, afro-cuban jazz, jungle, IDM, and\ntwo very special laptop specialists.\n\nFREE CASCADIA - Focusing primarily on local Seattle talent, Free Cascadia\nwill embody the musical equivalent of the political diversity its name\nimplies. Expect live bands, DJs and Live PAs covering the spectrum from\nTechno to Rock, Downtempo to Electro, Hip Hop to IDM and all points in\nbetween.\n\nSPIRALNITE - This stage is being run by an extremely enthusiastic Seattle\nbased crew, Spiral Nights is going to feature headliners from Seattle and\nPortland. Expect a focus on House, Jungle, Live DnB and Techno. These folks\nare bridging the gap between the Seattle and Portland Electronic Dance\nCommunities. \n\nOf course, the performances at Phoenix Festival are not all about music. If\nyou've been before we know that you've come to expect far more and this year\nis certainly no exception!\n\n99 EYES:\nWe have invited some very special and bizarre folks to come out this year.\n999 EYES ov Endless Dream CARNVIAL SIDESHOW ov thee DAMNED will be running\ntheir cirkus 24 hours a day throughout the duration of the event. Daytime\nshows will be very much on the whimsical side, but as the sun sets be\nprepared for the darkness to set in. Presented in association with\nInternational Maggott Theatre, Societas Insomnia, KatabatiK\nMetacommunications Platform, the Day ov the Zombie, Summon Creature Theatre,\nand the Sour Mash Hug band, this will be something you will not soon forget.\nOver 100 anarcho-punk style circus performers hailing from troupes across\nthe united states will converge on the fest for a sweet injection of the\nbizarre. \n\nSATI:\nSticking with tradition, we have asked a group to come out and perform for\nyou each night at midnight to help get things warmed up. Sati will be\nconveying the story of the Phoenix and The Dragon this year. They will be\nworking in conjunction with several members of the cirkus to blow your minds\nwith a nightly performance guaranteed to light up the night. \n\nTHEMECAMPS:\nAnd now, we come to another favorite element of the festival -- the theme\ncamps. A lot of the old favorites are back to serve as faithful distractions\nas you wander around the festival. Potluck, ChickenHed, Novatron Lounge,\nCamp Cooler and 1derland will be out in full force as well as many many\nothers. And if you are interested in a themecamp yourself, there is no need\nto register, come on out and do your thing -- we welcome you with open arms.\nHowever if you would like to register, we'll list you on on our website.\nJust go to the themecamp page here: www.phoenixfest.com/camps.html.</blockquote>\n\n"

Where my Dell feels like, well, a laptop, the IBM feels like my Compaq laptop I have that was made about seven years ago: It feels like I could throw it out a window (as they have videos doing on IBM's website) and it would be fine.\n\nThe keyboard and buttons feel much better on the IBM (they aren't as dainty) but the trackpad feels too small.\n\nThis might be because it isn't a wide screen, but the keyboard also feels a bit small. My hands are too close together when I'm typing.\nSpeaking of the keyboard: there isn't a windows key! I hate computers that don't have a windows key.\n\nThe whole thing is butt-ugly. It's obvious that IBM is catering toward the corporate crowd rather than the younger crowd that Dell, Apple, Gateway, and everybody else pays attention too.\n\nThe first thing the ThinkPad does when you boot it up is format. Even though formatting and installing Linux is obviously the first thing I'd be doing if it was mine, it still makes me very happy that they're doing this for the normals. It means when you buy a new computer, it's actually clean! None of that free AOL crap that Dell-and-the-like submerge your computer in.\n\nAll in all, it's a great little box. It's a tough call, but I don't think I prefer it over mine (yet...we'll see how long it takes me to break mine), but I wish Dell would take a few cues from IBM (i.e. make these things a little sturdier)."

    vellum_post_677.body = u'<blockquote>Can one narrate time -- time as such, in and of itself? Most certainly not, what a foolish undertaking that would be. The story would go: "Time passed, ran on, flowed in a might stream," and on and on in the same vein. No one with any common sense could call that a narrative. It would be the same as if someone took the harebrained notion of holding a single note or chord for hours on end -- and called it music. Because a story is like music in that it <i>fills</i> time, "fills it up so nice and properly," "divides it up," so that there is "something to it," "something going on" -- to quote, with the melancholy reverence one shows to statements made by the dead, a few casual comments of the late Joachim, phrases that faded away long ago, and we are not sure if the reader is quite clear just how long ago that was. Time is the <i>element</i> of narration, just as it is the element of life -- is inextricably bound up with it, as bodies are in space. It it also the element of music, which itself measures and divides time, making it suddenly diverting and precious; and related to music, as we have noted, is the story, which also can only present itself in successive events, as movements toward an end (and not as something suddenly, brilliantly present, like a work of visual art, which is pure body bound to time), and even if it would try to be totally here in each moment, would still need time for its presentation.\n\nThat much is perfectly obvious. But that there is a difference is equally clear. The time element of music is singular: a segment of human earthly existence in which it gushes forth, thereby ineffably enhancing and ennobling life. Narrative, however, has two kinds of time: first, its own real time, which like musical time defines its movement and presentation; and second, the time of its contents, which has a perspective quality that can vary widely, from a story in which the narrative\'s imaginary time is almost, or indeed totally coincident with its musical time, to one in which it stretches out over light-years. A musical piece entitled "Five Minute Waltz" lasts five minutes -- this and only this defines its relationship to time. A story whose contents involved a time span of five minutes, however, could, by means of an extraordinary scrupulosity in filling up those five minutes, last a thousand times as long -- and still remain short on boredom, although in relationship to its imaginary time it would be very long in the telling. On the other hand, it is possible for a narrative\'s content-time to exceed its own duration immeasurably. This is accomplished by diminishment -- and we use this term to describe an illusory, or, to be quite explicit, diseased element, that is obviously pertinent here: diminishment occurs to some extent whenever a narrative makes use of hermetic magic and a temporal hyperperspective reminiscent of certain anomalous experiences of reality that imply that the senses have been transcended. The diaries of opium-eaters record how, during the brief period of ecstasy, the drugged person\'s dreams have a temporal scope of ten, thirty, sometimes sixty years or even surpass all limits of man\'s ability to experience time -- dreams, that is, whose imaginary time span vastly exceeds their actual duration and which are characterized by an incredible diminishment of time, with images thronging past so swiftly that, as one hashish-smoker puts it, the intoxicated user\'s brain seems "to have had something removed, like the mainspring from a broken watch."\n\nA narrative, then, can set to work and deal with time in much the same way as those depraved dreams. But since it can "deal" with time, it is clear that time, which is the element of the narrative, can also become its <i>subject</i>; and although it would be going too far to say that one can "narrate time," it is apparently not such an absurd notion to want to narrate <i>about time</i> -- so that a term like "time novel" may well take on an oddly dreamlike double meaning...</blockquote>\n\nThomas Mann, The Magic Mountain'
    vellum_post_677.body_rendered = u'<blockquote>Can one narrate time &#8212; time as such, in and of itself? Most certainly not, what a foolish undertaking that would be. The story would go: &#8220;Time passed, ran on, flowed in a might stream,&#8221; and on and on in the same vein. No one with any common sense could call that a narrative. It would be the same as if someone took the harebrained notion of holding a single note or chord for hours on end &#8212; and called it music. Because a story is like music in that it <i>fills</i> time, &#8220;fills it up so nice and properly,&#8221; &#8220;divides it up,&#8221; so that there is &#8220;something to it,&#8221; &#8220;something going on&#8221; &#8212; to quote, with the melancholy reverence one shows to statements made by the dead, a few casual comments of the late Joachim, phrases that faded away long ago, and we are not sure if the reader is quite clear just how long ago that was. Time is the <i>element</i> of narration, just as it is the element of life &#8212; is inextricably bound up with it, as bodies are in space. It it also the element of music, which itself measures and divides time, making it suddenly diverting and precious; and related to music, as we have noted, is the story, which also can only present itself in successive events, as movements toward an end (and not as something suddenly, brilliantly present, like a work of visual art, which is pure body bound to time), and even if it would try to be totally here in each moment, would still need time for its presentation.\n\nThat much is perfectly obvious. But that there is a difference is equally clear. The time element of music is singular: a segment of human earthly existence in which it gushes forth, thereby ineffably enhancing and ennobling life. Narrative, however, has two kinds of time: first, its own real time, which like musical time defines its movement and presentation; and second, the time of its contents, which has a perspective quality that can vary widely, from a story in which the narrative&#8217;s imaginary time is almost, or indeed totally coincident with its musical time, to one in which it stretches out over light-years. A musical piece entitled &#8220;Five Minute Waltz&#8221; lasts five minutes &#8212; this and only this defines its relationship to time. A story whose contents involved a time span of five minutes, however, could, by means of an extraordinary scrupulosity in filling up those five minutes, last a thousand times as long &#8212; and still remain short on boredom, although in relationship to its imaginary time it would be very long in the telling. On the other hand, it is possible for a narrative&#8217;s content-time to exceed its own duration immeasurably. This is accomplished by diminishment &#8212; and we use this term to describe an illusory, or, to be quite explicit, diseased element, that is obviously pertinent here: diminishment occurs to some extent whenever a narrative makes use of hermetic magic and a temporal hyperperspective reminiscent of certain anomalous experiences of reality that imply that the senses have been transcended.

Of course I wanted Linux. I wasn\'t quite sure what distro I wanted to put on it, but I was leaning towards Slack.\nThe first order of business was to burn the Slackware 10.1 ISOs I\'d downloaded earlier. I swear I was in Windows for at least 45 minutes trying to figure out how to burn a damn ISO. After that I just got fed up with it, formatted and installed Suse (which, by the way, resized and kept the Windows partitions. Interesting). After about three seconds in Suse I was burning the images.\nAnd they call Windows user-friendly...\n\nThe next few hours were spent distro-whoring. I went through Suse, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and Slackware, finally settling on Slack.\n\nGetting everything to work in Slackware took a little work, but wasn\'t too much trouble.\n\nThe first thing was, of course, to install the Nvidia drivers. Grabbing them off Nvidia\'s site and installing them the normal way works fine (ignore the warning the installer gives about the conflicting rivafb module). My trouble was getting X to load after that. With the help of Google, I was able to make a custom <span class="removed_link">xorg.conf</span> that worked just dandy.\n\nThe second thing I wanted working was the wireless, which uses the <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/" >ipw2200</a> module. I don\'t know if it supports kernel 2.4, but I couldn\'t get it working without upgrading to 2.6 (slackware 10.1 still ships with 2.4, with 2.6 in /testing).\nUpgrading to 2.6 is easy. Simply read the README.initrd in <a href="http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-10.1/testing/packages/linux-2.6.10/" >/testing/packages/linux-2.6.10/</a>. In the step that has you <i>installpkg</i> everything, I\'d also add <a href="http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-10.1/testing/packages/linux-2.6.10/kernel-source-2.6.10-noarch-1.tgz" >kernel-source</a> (44MB).\nWhen I got 2.6 running, it was a simple matter of doing <i>make</i>, <i>make install</i> on ipw2200. Then I extracted the <a href="http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/firmware.php" >firmware</a> to /lib/firmware. After that finishes:\n<blockquote>modprobe ipw2200 <i>loads the wireless</i>\niwconfig <i>find the name of the interface (eth0 for me)</i>\ndhcpcd eth0 <i>get an ip</i></blockquote>\nAlso, reading the iwconfig man page is helpful.\n\nNow the wireless is running. To switch back to the wired connection, do a\n<blockquote>modprobe -r ipw2200\nmodprobe b44 <i>(this is the NIC module)</i>\nifconfig eth0 up</blockquote>\n\nThe next thing was sound. Since I\'d upgraded to 2.6, I needed to install the new <a href="http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-10.1/testing/packages/linux-2.6.10/alsa-driver-1.0.8_2.6.10-i486-1.tgz" >alsa-drivers</a>. After that, there\'s the problem of a conflicting module named <i>snd_intel8x0m</i> (something to do with modem sound). That needs to be removed and added to the blacklist.\n<blockquote>modprobe -r snd_intel8x0m\npico /etc/hotplug/blacklist</blockquote>\nNow all that\'s left to do is run <i>alsaconf</i> and <i>alsamixer</i> to adjust volume.\n\nIt\'s been running great for a few days now. The only thing I\'m still working on is getting ACPI fully working (i.e. making the screen turn off when it\'s closed).'

You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.\n\nGovernments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.\n\nYou have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.\n\nYou claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don\'t exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.\n\nCyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.\n\nWe are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.\n\nWe are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.\n\nYour legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.\n\nOur identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.\n\nIn the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.\n\nYou are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.\n\nIn China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.\n\nYour increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.\n\nThese increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.\n\nWe will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.

International News Agent Provocateur\n\nThe Republican National Convention was the ultimate slight to New York: those who made careers and a quick buck off the September 11th events returned to feast like vultures on the corpses of the dead, attempting to rally support for a failing war and a disastrous regime by parading around near the site of Ground Zero. As one might suspect, there were going to be protests, courtesy of an amalgamation of New Yorkers and out-of-town protesters, direct action anarchists and anti-war pacifists, community groups and Marxist sects. The question of the hour was: Were the protests going to bring the house of cards down?\n\nThe answer is no, they didn\'t, but there were signs that this will be possible - and soon. The RNC 2004 protests showed that resistance is possible in this country quickly sliding towards old-fashioned homeland fascism: a vast multitude of people are getting ready to roll against the corporate aristocracy that runs this country. And many in New York are willing put their bodies on the line against the regime.\n\nTo understand the historic importance of this protest, one must know a little of its genealogy. The RNC 2000 protest in Philadelphia was the first major failure of the anti-globalization movement, a movement that had seemed unstoppable after Seattle, and its long shadow hung over the minds of many of us as we prepared for the 2004 RNC. The failure in Philly was primarily a failure of imagination and organization: the organizers attempted to repeat a "shut-down the city" protest - complete with blockades, a risky proposition on the East Coast where those skills are less common than on the West Coast - without sufficient numbers. Heavy-handed police tactics succeeded in thwarting this strategy, setting a precedent for militarized repression that culminated in the so-called "Miami Model" during the protests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas ministerial in 2003. Ever since the RNC 2000 protests, anarchists have whispered about decentralized action as an alternative to badly-planned centralized action.\n\nBefore September 11th, the anti-globalization movement was becoming increasingly anarchist in orientation, pursuing increasingly militant tactics in the streets and developing a sophisticated analysis of global capitalism. After September 11th, the anti-globalization movement let the traditional authoritarian Left, such as the Marxist-Leninist ANSWER or their more liberal counterparts in UFPJ, seize control of the anti-war movement. These groups discouraged actual direct action, while occasionally borrowing the rhetoric of confrontation from more militant groups. Soon, these elitist organizers had set the movement back to marching around in circles. While many did their best - as massive direct actions from San Francisco to New York on the eve of the Iraq war showed - to put their bodies on the line to halt the war machine, the authoritarian Left did all it could to divert energy away from genuine resistance. As any veteran of the anti-war movement of the Sixties could have foreseen, mere marches could not and did not stop the war. All the same, the vast networks, such as Indymedia, created by the militant anti-globalization movement became vital to the anti-war movement.the networks and influence of the anarchist underground were continuing to spread.\n\nPopular hatred against the government, particularly as symbolized by its leading figurehead George W. Bush, was at an all-time high. Kids were coming home in bodybags from a war based on lies, the economy was in shambles, and the government was obviously run by a self-interested rich elite. This was a socially volatile situation to say the least. Unlike at the 2000 RNC, there were going to be massive numbers of protesters, and it appeared people were finally fed up enough to do something more than march in circles. The gambit was that the spirit and tactics of Seattle could merge with the massive numbers of the anti-war movement: combined, they would be unstoppable.\n\nA year in advance, the website www.rncnotwelcome.org had been set up to coordinate these protests. Although anarchists were often caricatured as an alienated balaclava-clad minority, in reality they were the backbone of the organizing around the RNC. The main group that handled legal at the RNC was the explicitly anarchist People\'s Law Collective, with the help of the National Lawyer\'s Guild. The noRNC Clearinghouse meetings were started by anarchists, and these meetings enabled a wide variety of groups to plan for the protests. Anarchists organized housing, put up posters, and, with their usual humility, did much of the dirty work, without bothering to tell the world of their political affiliations.\n\nIn New York City, during the months preceding the RNC, Republicans not only lacked support but were openly hated. For example, while I was eating a falafel in Queens, the chef came out and gave me a flyer for the anti-RNC protests, telling me to be there. I assured him I was going to be. Later, I observed a well-dressed, evidently Republican young man tearing down anti-RNC posters. He was caught red-handed in the act by myself and a New Yorker, and with the approval bystanders, was quickly scared into running away. One local actually grabbed the poster and put it back up.\n\nNew York is the essence of the city taken to its almost illogical conclusion: miles and miles of skyscrapers and concrete, so large that it is always teetering on the edge of collapse, with only 40,000 cops standing between capitalism and chaos. Among its massive numbers, there is a wide range of groups that have been excluded, marginalized, and exploited: everyone from old Puerto Rican men working in community gardens in the Bronx to radical lesbian biker performance artists. This diversity in turn makes New York one of the most explosive and exciting places for radical politics. Yet New York is also large enough to be home to some of the most retrograde elements in North American radical politics: ridiculous Leninist cults such as the Revolutionary Communist Party, liberal activist superstars, and continual infighting. This makes planning a centralized protest almost impossible - there are simply too many variables to take into account, and even anarchists have trouble getting along together. But if one thing could draw people together, it was the common outrage against the Republicans.\nDecentralization Beyond the Point of No Return\nThe noRNC Clearinghouse meetings were crucial for creating the infrastructure needed, opening a non-denominational space in which everyone from United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) to Shutdown NYC could get together to coordinate, make announcements, and connect to others. As the RNC drew closer, the noRNC Clearinghouse meetings had so many participants that it took hours just for all the groups to proclaim their plans. Instead of becoming a spokescouncil for the entire protest, the clearinghouse transformed itself into the noRNC bazaar. The bazaar was a far cry from a consensus meeting; groups set up tables and solicited people to join their actions. There was a spokescouncil for the A31 Direct Action on Tuesday, but this spokescouncil only dealt with that day.s actions, not the protest as a whole. Much to everyone\'s surprise, St. Marks Church wasn\'t set up explicitly as a convergence center, although that space functioned as an informal hang-out and meeting spot. Initiatives such as the Anarchist World\'s Fair encouraged anarchists to come early, and events ranging from the academic "Life After Capitalism" to the down and dirty "Really Really Free Market" heightened the energy in the air. The RNC was a grand experiment: everything was completely decentralized. As the communique delivered by the NYC Anarchist Grapevine said, "We should all finally face it - there is no Big Plan." Just show up and see what was going down, or organize something yourself.that was the zeitgeist. Beautiful maps of New York City featuring multi-racial kissing pirates, subway stops, and corporate targets were provided a la carte.\n\nAs the dates of the RNC drew nearer, some were getting butterflies in their collective stomachs about this lack of concrete action plans. One advantage of openly decentralizing the action plans was that many groups creatively called for autonomous actions: the "Mouse Bloc" and "Chaos on Broadway" call to interrupt the delegates as they watched Broadway shows, the humorous "Man in Black Bloc" call to reclaim Johnny Cash from the Republicans, and a host of increasingly surreal calls like the "Viking Bloc" were all examples of this. While this decentralized model opened space for autonomous action, it was unclear if the maturity and vision to plan even a single fully realized, effective decentralized action existed anywhere. The lack of a central spokescouncil prevented incompetent groups from taking control and instead invested faith in the people themselves, which is an inherently anarchist strategy for success; however, the fact of the matter was that while many were empowered, many coming in from out of town were bewildered. Most had neither the experience nor the time to organize their own direct actions or even navigate New York City properly. This enabled authoritarian groups that organize behind closed doors to take center stage with their plans to march everyone aimlessly around - you guessed it - in circles.\n\nPredictably, they called for a large permitted march to go right by the Republican National Convention\'s location at Madison Square Garden. The march was to take place on Sunday, before the Convention even began, in order to maximize turnout and minimize possible conflict with the State. As one right wing website put it, "If this is the best the Revolution has to offer, the Establishment is safe." Monday was reserved for not only one, but two, three, many Poor People\'s Marches. Then out of nowhere, a group of West Coast activists parachuted in with the help of the usual suspects.the activists known during the RNC 2000 debacle as the Direct Action Network.to plan massive nonviolent civil disobedience in New York on Tuesday, hoping to repeat a success like the anti-war demonstrations in San Francisco.\n\nThe unprecedented decentralization of the RNC protests was perhaps the only way to organize in the chaos that is New York City, yet it left protesters with a schedule of events curiously similar to the Philly 2000 RNC protests. In fact, the schedule was almost exactly the same, down to the very days of the week. As experience has shown us consistently, anyone who suggests that protesters should divide their forces over a few days, with each day being reserved for one special type of protest, is a danger to all. Such a strategy always pans out in this way: on the first day of protest, usually a Sunday, there is a big march of a supposedly broad-based coalition, and the limits of this march are controlled by a small hierarchical group. Since these liberal and Marxist groups usually are well-funded, they can bring in bus-loads of people to march with them; they generally use the opportunity to hand-out mass-produced signs, sell newspapers, and bore people senseless with an endless array of carefully selected speakers. Most people leave town immediately after the big march is over. The next day, often a Monday, the various poor people\'s marches begin, usually being mostly local people of color groups. Since poor people are inherently more dangerous to the State than liberals marching around in circles, they get hassled or attacked by the police. Anarchists support both of these marches and join in them, creating infrastructure and support work often for both. On the last day of action - a Tuesday - people interested in direct action are finally permitted to take the reigns, but in complete isolation. They take to the streets by themselves and, having announcing their plans all over the Internet, are quickly arrested and brutalized by the police. Now that many of us have experienced this way of scheduling protests several times, it\'s hard not to see it as a sign of either sub-human intelligence or collaboration with the State - but in this aspect the protests against the RNC 2004 appeared to ape those against the RNC 2000.\n\nAfter Seattle, everyone agreed that we couldn\'t repeat that particular model, as the element of surprise was gone. However, while we have lost the element of surprise in massive demonstrations, the other crucial element of Seattle that can and should be repeated is synchronicity. The combination of well-coordinated organized lock-downs, massive and festive demonstrations that provided support for direct actions, and decentralized autonomous actions like squat take-overs and Black Blocs, all at the same time, is what made the Seattle protests impossible for the police to control. Whenever any of these elements is isolated, it will most likely fail. Our power lies in the ability of diverse groups to coordinate, each offering its strengths in mutually beneficial relationships with other groups that may be completely different in ideology and tactics. This is the true strength of any network-based anti-authoritarian movement. To declare a return to staid leftist marching under a unified banner as one faceless mass, or to proclaim that "militant Black Blocs" or "non-violent civil disobedience" is the one true tactical way forward.both of these approaches are ridiculous and potentially detrimental to what potential we have. Anarchists should set the stage, then do whatever it is they do best in conjunction with everyone else, all at the same time. It\'s a simple recipe, yet it\'s never really been repeated in the United States on a large scale since the IMF/World Bank protests in 2000.\n\nMany anarchists organizing for the RNC were veterans of Seattle and other successful anti-globalization protests, and were hoping that the RNC protests would follow such a model. Yet UFPJ, lest their good names be tarred with the taint of actual direct action, did their best so keep their march separate from the direct action and civil disobedience. In the vain hope that we could somehow make an alliance with them, many anarchists did not openly confront UFPJ. In reality, old-fashioned Leftist groups like the UFPJ leadership are taking advantage of all the hard work of the anarchists and then throwing them into the jaws of the State. Since many Marxist-Leninists and liberals, as well as the frightening "anarcho-liberals," are career activists, they don\'t actually want to change things - if they did, they\'d be out of a job - so they naturally avoided any real disruption of the RNC.\n\nFortunately, anarchists and others who were more interested in action sent out calls for direct actions. These included a giant critical mass organized by Time\'s Up, a unified direct action and direct democracy "Don\'t Just Vote Take Action" contingent in the UFPJ march, a "Mouse Bloc" to personally confront the delegates Sunday night, and the A31 call to - shut down the RNC - on Tuesday. The possibility that the massive numbers of the anti-war movement would join in with the direct action tactics of the anti-globalization movement was negated by the scheduling of events. However, despite the best attempts of the police, media, and liberals to demoralize and divide the protesters, including a few "radicals" like Todd Gitlin humorously showing their true colors by saying any protest would just play into the hands of the Republicans, it was clear that something big was going to happen.\n\nThings were heating up, and even UFPJ\'s rhetoric took a turn to direct action as they were prevented from going to Central Park and instead forced to turn around and go to Union Square. Although the war of words over which symbolic goal would be reached was a bit humorous, Mayor Bloomberg and the powers that be were getting scared. In an act of high comedy, the City began offering discounts at shops and museums to protesters who signed an agreement to be peaceful. Obviously the mayor hoped to obscure the fact that many of the protesters were there primarily to act against capitalism. Had the Queen offered to give Boston Tea Party protesters some Nestea coupons in return for a promise of pacifism, would we still be swearing "God Save the Queen"? The media proclaimed that "Anarchy Inc." was going to take down the city. In a special "leak" from the police, the media revealed fifty of the country\'s leading anarchists, each with fifty loyal followers willing to sacrifice themselves for their leader (?!), were being trailed by individually assigned goon squads. Obviously, all the money in the newfound massive intelligence budgets of the NYPD and FBI can.t make up for their fundamental lack of human intelligence. Virtually no anarchists any of us know were actually trailed, except for those who have appeared on major television channels in the last few years as "anarchist" media spokespeople. We all know those people are not involved in direct action in reality, due to the nature of their roles as media spokespeople.\n\nIn an effort to help turn the tide of fear, a media event was held entitled "Are You an Anarchist? The Answer May Surprise You." The participants ranged from the preacher Father Frank Morales of St. Mark.s Place to Kazembe Balagoon, author of "Queering the X: James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and the Third World." As Warcry reminded the media, the real violence is never caused by the demonstrators, but the capitalist system, which is busy destroying the foundations upon which all of life rests. Since neither candidate is in favor of abolishing capitalism, no matter who wins the election, we all lose. Starhawk ended the session by reminding the media that the President personally condones violence as our official foreign policy, which puts a few streets clogged by sit-downs and the possibility of a broken window into perspective.\nThe Protest that Never Sleeps\nThe protests began in earnest on Thursday with an upbeat touch, as the RNC2DNC march arrived from the Democratic National Convention in Boston wearing Zapatista masks, breaking the law to bring the message of the Lacandon jungle home against the impressive backdrop of New York City\'s glass-plated skyscrapers.\n\nTime\'s Up! had been busy repairing bikes for weeks before the RNC. Their work set the stage for the great role bicycles played throughout the entire protest. On Friday night, the largest Critical Mass in NYC history seized the street in defiance of the terrifying environmental costs of this oil-driven civilization. Over five thousand bikers of all stripes and colors seized the streets for two hours, fouling up traffic in Manhattan and generally humiliating the police, who have never been able to control Critical Mass in NYC.\n\nAs things wound down, the Critical Mass returned to St. Mark\'s Church, and the cops attacked, targeting random bikers, breaking bones, and arresting anyone who tried to prevent them from doing so. In one telling moment, a few cops walked into the middle of St. Mark\'s Church and arrested someone, even when they were surrounded by hundreds of protesters who could have stopped them. Still, for the most part the bikers managed to evade this repression and accomplish their goals. It was clear the battle was on, and the NYPD were playing for keeps. Instead of using the high-tech weaponry favored by police at Miami, the NYPD were going to rely on old-fashioned clubs, numbers, and beatdowns.\n\nOn Sunday, the UFPJ march slowly but surely gathered in the streets. Earlier, when the permit for the rally in Central Park had been denied, there had been rumors that people were going to try to march to Central Park anyway, regardless of what the UFPJ leadership said. While on many levels both possible destinations for the march were merely symbolic goals, marching to Central Park would have placed the march going right through Broadway around the time the Mouse Bloc was to confront the RNC delegates as they attended musicals. The feeling among local anarchists was that a giant Black Bloc at the march would have caused police to single us out for attack - in retrospect that might not have been the case, or even have been a bad thing if it had happened, but at the time anarchists from out of town took the advise of the locals seriously. To provide an alternative, the Don\'t Just Vote Get Active campaign called for a "Unified Direct Democracy and Direct Action" contingent to deliver "a radical message to what otherwise might be a reformist event." Gathering the Rhythm Workers Union and the Infernal Noise Brigade, the Pagans and the Greens, colorful hippies and black-clad anarcho-punks, pink-clad musicians and radical cheerleaders; this amalgamation grew into one of the largest and most festive contingents in the entire march.\n\nA huge Green Dragon of Self-Determination led the entire contingent, taking up almost an entire block. A small group of people with strange signs urging people to "disassemble the totality of power," holding black umbrellas to hide themselves from the ever-present cameras filming on the tops of buildings, gathered behind the dragon. Others danced in front of the dragon, and the march seemed to be riding a crest of sheer joy as it approached Madison Square Garden, where the convention was to be held. At this juncture, right in front of the convention center, the sound system of the dragon finally ran out of batteries. In this opening, the Pagans began their inspiring Spiral Dance, and then, as Starhawk of the pagan cluster wrote, she felt "some powerful earth energy, a kind of raw life force that pulsed and thundered and rose up into a great, focused cone of power. Someone told me to look behind, and in the relatively empty space between us and the line of cops at 34th St., the dragon was burning." The Green Dragon had burst into flames. Police retreated behind their barricades, and then gathered forces and began arresting people at random. A spontaneous Black Bloc appeared, defending themselves from the attacking police by throwing bottles as the flames raged behind them.\n\nTo this day, no one knows exactly why the Green Dragon went up in smoke. I was dancing relatively near it and have no idea if it was a malfunction, a Pagan spell, an undercover Black Bloc using the Green Dragon as a Trojan Horse, or just some random act of madness. Regardless, in this downright surreal course of events, it became clear to me as the crowd fought back against the police assault that at least some people were bored of marching around aimlessly in circles and wanted to take militant direct action against the powers of the State. At one point, the cops even retreated from the crowd.\n\nWe should be very careful about saying that anything is caused by "police provocateurs," unless there is solid evidence. I remember groups like Ya Basta! floating the same accusations around Genoa against the Black Bloc. It\'s always easy for protest organizers to call "police provocateurs" those militants who refuse to be corralled into their "organized" plans. While the burning dragon on strictly rational grounds made little sense except as a visceral manifestation of discontent, there was something fitting about a giant bonfire being set only a few yards from the castle of the self-proclaimed rulers of the world. If only the fire was on the inside!\n\nUnfortunately, the march turned dead around instead of forcing its way to Central Park. UFPJ marshals told the marchers to try to make their way to Central Park individually, in what could only feel like an anti-climax. Many anarchists and other angry citizens who weren\'t already at Broadway went there to participate in the "Chaos on Broadway" and "Mouse Bloc" actions. This is where another phase in direct action began, one that fit almost perfectly the personality of New York City: small groups followed Republican delegates around New York and made their lives a living hell by being as rude as possible to them. On Broadway, I was greeted by an amazing sight: hundreds of protesters gathering in both large clumps and small clusters, undercover cops everywhere but seemingly unable to do anything, hundreds of ordinary tourists wandering about, and the cops generally losing control of the situation. As I walked out of the subway, I heard a girl scream as she fell, nearly wrapped in this strange orange mesh the cops were using to attempt to corral people, literally knocked off her feet by a cop.\n\nGenerally, the rule seemed to be that groups of protesters who were wearing bandannas, holding up anti-Bush banners, or dressing in even more black than is usual in New York City, were targeted by the police and arrested as soon as they attempted to do anything even mildly illegal. The police even arrested the participants in a giant kiss-in. One can almost hear the officer saying, "We can\'t have those queers kissing in public, it\'s a threat to public order!" However, many protesters were dressed for the occasion, easily blending into the constant stream of tourists on Broadway. The cops were unable to arrest everybody, as the Republicans, protesters, and unsuspecting people passing by were mixed together. The protesters appeared as if by magic just where the Republicans were, as the Republicans could be easily identified by their blue tuxedos and red badges, as well as their pasty all-white faces and the gleam of greed and religious fundamentalism in their eyes.\n\nThe organizational backbone of the whole event was the text messaging txtmob.org set up the Institute for Applied Autonomy. A network is only as powerful as its communications. Tactical information about the location of the police and the Republican delegates was sent out to hundreds of small groups of protesters, who used the information to gather and disperse quickly. It was the second coming of smart mobs, a fading trend given new life by a political objective.\n\nOne of my friends nearly caused a delegate to choke him in anger by remarking how he would love to engage in homoerotic acts with said delegate. As the delegate removed his chokehold from my friend\'s neck, my friend calmly stared him in the eyes and told him that "Your entire cock could fit inside my mouth." At that moment, the delegate\'s small mind cracked and he just lost whatever sanity he had left. Further down, a small bloc of anarchists terrified Republicans by blocking them with a black banner and chanting that "Right-wing scum, your time has come!" It was definitely not a pleasant night out on the town for the would-be masters of the universe. The arrogance of the Republican delegates was shocking: most of them didn\'t even have security or bodyguards. I walked right up to one of them who looked like John McCain and told him he would wish that the Vietnamese had finished him off after what we Americans were going to do to him because of Iraq. I hope I had the right senator! Regardless, everywhere the delegates went there were both peace signs and fingers in the air, and the promise of "RNC Not Welcome" fulfilled itself, lasting hours until the cops finally managed to arrest several hundred people and the remaining protesters left tired but smiling.\n\nOn Monday, the several Poor People\'s Marches took place. I showed up at the Kensington Welfare Rights March to help a friend of mine manage a large "Boxing Bush" puppet, a life-sized effigy of Bush made especially for people to punch - the perfect puppet for inciting rowdy behavior in a crowd. I noticed a strange dynamic, as white middle-class activists told me to "stop causing trouble" and put our puppet away. While a white liberal told me I was distracting the gathered poor people from listening to yet another speaker, lots of people, especially kids, had a hell of a fun time punching the living daylights out of Bush. I wondered how the previous night\'s events would have gone had we had some more of these people on the streets with us to hassle the Republicans. When the march finally got going, the true class war began, as police put on their riot gear. The cops were absolutely idiotic and reckless, harassing and arresting people just for dual crimes of marching and being poor. At another poor people\'s march the police claim that an African-American protester gave an undercover a boot in the jaw. Quick point to remember: if the cops claim you assaulted a police officer and your face is on television, do not march around the next day in broad daylight. The police nabbed this man the next day. He\'s the kind of guy we need to maintain solidarity with, even if he isn\'t a card-carrying member of Anarchy Inc.\n\nThe direct action plans for Tuesday originated as some strange plan for a coordinated primal scream. When I went to one of the planning spokescouncil meetings, they were passing around a flower to denote who was given the floor to speak. While I understand there are cultural differences between the East and West Coast, I somehow had difficulty imagining actual New Yorkers in that meeting. Still, when the day of action on Tuesday actually took place, it was impressive. Using the same text-messaging techniques employed successfully in the Broadway actions, large masses of people attempted to block intersections and hassle delegates, bringing large parts of Manhattan to a standstill. The police responded by arresting as many people as they could, as quickly as possible, with little regard to what they were actually doing or if any laws were being broken. At one point cops surrounded me and a friend with the dreaded orange netting. The orange netting was more of a psychological barrier than a physical one: riled up crowds sometimes broke through it. However, most of the crowd I was with didn\'t even seem to notice that they were about to be mass-arrested. I walked calmly up to a cop, stared him straight in the eye, and said "You are not arresting me. I\'m not a protester. Let me go." The Jedi mind trick worked, and the cop meekly opened up the orange netting to let me and my friend out. Reports kept flooding in that people were sitting in the streets blocking traffic, and groups like the True Security Cluster did in fact seize a block occasionally.\n\nWhile the police were arresting people, things were getting out of hand. Some members of my affinity group managed to find themselves face to face with Barbara Bush and George Bush Sr., but the Secret Service arrived before we could effectively confront the former President. Meanwhile, one member of the People\'s Law Collective went outside their office for a smoke break, and was pleasantly shocked to see piles of burning trash along Madison Avenue!\nThere\'s a Song Beneath the Concrete\nIf anything, the RNC protests showed that domestic dissent is alive and well in the United States in the face of the creeping fascism of the Bush regime. This happened against overwhelming odds, and broke a spell of several years of bad luck. It had seemed that the anti-globalization was movement was in retreat since September 11th, unable to adapt its tactics and strategies to the new era of perpetual war and heavy repression. The large anti-globalization summit-protests seemed to be faltering and the anti-war protests ineffectual, with the harrowing nightmare of Miami was still fresh in many people\'s minds. In the face of such odds, the RNC protests were a powerful showing of a popular uprising. They stole the media spotlight from the Republicans. The amount of new groups, new faces, and new alliances was overwhelming. Anarchist politics and culture have been kept alive, and a whole new generation is ready to commit their lives to the battle between people and power.\n\nThis is a cultural triumph, since just five years ago at Seattle many anarchists felt purposefully excluded for their "too radical" political beliefs. Not only that, but anarchists are hip! A school-teacher friend of mine ran into kids in Queens who were debating the pros and cons of CrimethInc.\'s "Evasion" and "Off the Map." Besides being easily pigeon-holed into the doddering Black Bloc tradition, anarchists of all kinds, from the Radical Reference librarians to the squatters helping out Casa del Sol, were present everywhere. On every level, the direct action movement has shifted toward anarchist decentralized network models of organizing and action. The use of mobile phone technology to communicate tactical information via texting was put to great use. Dressing normally allowed anarchists to infiltrate Republican events.\n\nThis was not a pro-Democrat protest: almost everyone I talked to there hated the Republicans but realized that the Democrats did not offer a real alternative. There was almost no pro-Kerry sentiment in evidence, and most protesters claimed that the entire system was bankrupt. More and more people are being drawn to an increasingly radical analysis of capitalism, from MTA workers to veterans back from Iraq. In the words of one paper anarchists distributed at the RNC, "It\'s not Just Bush, It\'s the System"!\n\nWhy did anarchists let hierarchical groups like UFPJ direct events like the Sunday march from behind closed doors, when it was clear that those were the main body of the protests? Like it or not, if we truly believe that decisions should be open, democratic, and available to all, we can\'t back down on that stance on the grounds that we need to make some sort of tactical alliance with liberals and crypto-leninists. Since it was anarchists who were doing much if not most of the actual work for the protests, we were in a position to tell UFPJ that they needed to open up their process and operate by at least a consensus-based spokescouncil; this might even have provoked a coup from within their grassroots membership, which is continually irritated at the sheer lack of backbone of their leadership. Often spokescouncils are just platforms for authoritarian cliques, yet as a forum a spokescouncil is better than none at all. After all, where else do we go to announce we are going to disagree with the plan, propose better plans, and meet our friends from out of town?\n\nThe authoritarian Left is not our friends: if anything, they are holding back the power of people everywhere to take action. We need to stop pandering to union hierarchies and washed-up Marxists. We can provide spaces for people to take as much action as they feel comfortable with, such as the Green, Yellow, and Red Zones did in the Quebec City anti-FTAA protests. We can build alliances with groups that matter like the poor people of the Bronx who fight against the system for survival everyday. Let\'s not tolerate a conscious return to outdated tactics and organizing, even from those of supposedly "anarchist" backgrounds who backslide into retrograde Leninist and liberal behavior, as Chomksy did in pleading with people to vote for Kerry. Let\'s keep up the prison support - Banno is still up on trumped-up felony charges for the burning puppet incident, and a movement is only as strong as its prisoner support is.\n\nOne more concern is worth voicing - the attrition rate in our community. We anarchists are the most experienced wing of the direct action movement. The generation that gave us Seattle was built up out of nearly a decade of largely unsung valuable work within groups such as Earth First! and Anti-Racist Action - but where is the Seattle generation now? Far too many experienced anarchists have gone into early retirement, which is both ludicrous and pompous since the situation has only gotten more oppressive since September 11th, not less, and most of the world does not have the luxury to retire to a comfortable life-style of dumpster-diving, gardening, or writing theory. We have to be in the front lines until the day we die or win, spreading our collective knowledge so we can finally have a multi-generational movement of resistance in the United States.\n\nAs anarchists, it\'s not our job to lead by giving commands. We lead by being an inspiring example, and the RNC was an example. We need more heroic examples to show that resistance is possible. The vast majority of people are so caught up within this system of oppression and despair that they cannot imagine another way of life. We can show it is possible by building gardens in abandoned parking lots, by not letting police brutality go unpunished, by fighting police in the streets whenever their masters come to town. We need to show that the Republicans, the G8, the Empire - call it what you will - doesn\'t rule the world, but that the power to reshape the world lies in their own hands. It is these demonstrations, in which people realize their own strength and apply it, that keep us inspired and still fighting. The liberals and the remnants of the old Left falsely posit themselves as "representatives" of the people in order to constrain the possible choices and actions of the people. This makes them functionally, if not ideologically, complicit with the forces of the state. We anarchists seek not to represent the people, for we know people can only represent themselves. If someone truly does not want to riot, if they truly want to march around in circles, we respect that choice. Still, judging from the numbers of people who were interested in taking action at the RNC, there is clear evidence this tendency towards action is back and growing. Even if the RNC protests seemed like only a small step, these are the small steps of an awakening giant.\n\nWhere are the mysterious anarchists? You\'ll find the mythical and dreaded anarchists, both facing off the cops in the streets and building infrastructure, working their fingers to the bone and risking it all for the greatest of stakes: freedom. We\'re not superheroes, but ordinary people, dirty and tired, weary yet still smiling, toiling away at mind-numbing drudgery and acting with unbelievable heroism for the dignity of life. We all have the courage we need within us. We can feel it in our bones and in the soil. As Aresh and the folks working in the community gardens in the Bronx know all too well, the soil is still rich and fertile beneath the concrete skyscrapers of New York. All that is required is that we have the courage to break open the concrete. And in New York, I could almost hear the concrete breaking.'

International News Agent Provocateur</p>\n<p>The Republican National Convention was the ultimate slight to New York: those who made careers and a quick buck off the September 11th events returned to feast like vultures on the corpses of the dead, attempting to rally support for a failing war and a disastrous regime by parading around near the site of Ground Zero. As one might suspect, there were going to be protests, courtesy of an amalgamation of New Yorkers and out-of-town protesters, direct action anarchists and anti-war pacifists, community groups and Marxist sects. The question of the hour was: Were the protests going to bring the house of cards down?</p>\n<p>The answer is no, they didn&#8217;t, but there were signs that this will be possible - and soon. The RNC 2004 protests showed that resistance is possible in this country quickly sliding towards old-fashioned homeland fascism: a vast multitude of people are getting ready to roll against the corporate aristocracy that runs this country. And many in New York are willing put their bodies on the line against the regime.</p>\n<p>To understand the historic importance of this protest, one must know a little of its genealogy. The RNC 2000 protest in Philadelphia was the first major failure of the anti-globalization movement, a movement that had seemed unstoppable after Seattle, and its long shadow hung over the minds of many of us as we prepared for the 2004 RNC. The failure in Philly was primarily a failure of imagination and organization: the organizers attempted to repeat a &#8220;shut-down the city&#8221; protest - complete with blockades, a risky proposition on the East Coast where those skills are less common than on the West Coast - without sufficient numbers. Heavy-handed police tactics succeeded in thwarting this strategy, setting a precedent for militarized repression that culminated in the so-called &#8220;Miami Model&#8221; during the protests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas ministerial in 2003. Ever since the RNC 2000 protests, anarchists have whispered about decentralized action as an alternative to badly-planned centralized action.</p>\n<p>Before September 11th, the anti-globalization movement was becoming increasingly anarchist in orientation, pursuing increasingly militant tactics in the streets and developing a sophisticated analysis of global capitalism. After September 11th, the anti-globalization movement let the traditional authoritarian Left, such as the Marxist-Leninist ANSWER or their more liberal counterparts in UFPJ, seize control of the anti-war movement. These groups discouraged actual direct action, while occasionally borrowing the rhetoric of confrontation from more militant groups. Soon, these elitist organizers had set the movement back to marching around in circles. While many did their best - as massive direct actions from San Francisco to New York on the eve of the Iraq war showed - to put their bodies on the line to halt the war machine, the authoritarian Left did all it could to divert energy away from genuine resistance. As any veteran of the anti-war movement of the Sixties could have foreseen, mere marches could not and did not stop the war. All the same, the vast networks, such as Indymedia, created by the militant anti-globalization movement became vital to the anti-war movement.the networks and influence of the anarchist underground were continuing to spread.</p>\n<p>Popular hatred against the government, particularly as symbolized by its leading figurehead George W. Bush, was at an all-time high. Kids were coming home in bodybags from a war based on lies, the economy was in shambles, and the government was obviously run by a self-interested rich elite. This was a socially volatile situation to say the least. Unlike at the 2000 RNC, there were going to be massive numbers of protesters, and it appeared people were finally fed up enough to do something more than march in circles. The gambit was that the spirit and tactics of Seattle could merge with the massive numbers of the anti-war movement: combined, they would be unstoppable.</p>\n<p>A year in advance, the website www.rncnotwelcome.org had been set up to coordinate these protests. Although anarchists were often caricatured as an alienated balaclava-clad minority, in reality they were the backbone of the organizing around the RNC. The main group that handled legal at the RNC was the explicitly anarchist People&#8217;s Law Collective, with the help of the National Lawyer&#8217;s Guild. The noRNC Clearinghouse meetings were started by anarchists, and these meetings enabled a wide variety of groups to plan for the protests. Anarchists organized housing, put up posters, and, with their usual humility, did much of the dirty work, without bothering to tell the world of their political affiliations.</p>\n<p>In New York City, during the months preceding the RNC, Republicans not only lacked support but were openly hated. For example, while I was eating a falafel in Queens, the chef came out and gave me a flyer for the anti-RNC protests, telling me to be there. I assured him I was going to be. Later, I observed a well-dressed, evidently Republican young man tearing down anti-RNC posters. He was caught red-handed in the act by myself and a New Yorker, and with the approval bystanders, was quickly scared into running away. One local actually grabbed the poster and put it back up.</p>\n<p>New York is the essence of the city taken to its almost illogical conclusion: miles and miles of skyscrapers and concrete, so large that it is always teetering on the edge of collapse, with only 40,000 cops standing between capitalism and chaos. Among its massive numbers, there is a wide range of groups that have been excluded, marginalized, and exploited: everyone from old Puerto Rican men working in community gardens in the Bronx to radical lesbian biker performance artists. This diversity in turn makes New York one of the most explosive and exciting places for radical politics. Yet New York is also large enough to be home to some of the most retrograde elements in North American radical politics: ridiculous Leninist cults such as the Revolutionary Communist Party, liberal activist superstars, and continual infighting. This makes planning a centralized protest almost impossible - there are simply too many variables to take into account, and even anarchists have trouble getting along together. But if one thing could draw people together, it was the common outrage against the Republicans.\nDecentralization Beyond the Point of No Return\nThe noRNC Clearinghouse meetings were crucial for creating the infrastructure needed, opening a non-denominational space in which everyone from United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) to Shutdown NYC could get together to coordinate, make announcements, and connect to others. As the RNC drew closer, the noRNC Clearinghouse meetings had so many participants that it took hours just for all the groups to proclaim their plans. Instead of becoming a spokescouncil for the entire protest, the clearinghouse transformed itself into the noRNC bazaar. The bazaar was a far cry from a consensus meeting; groups set up tables and solicited people to join their actions. There was a spokescouncil for the A31 Direct Action on Tuesday, but this spokescouncil only dealt with that day.s actions, not the protest as a whole. Much to everyone&#8217;s surprise, St. Marks Church wasn&#8217;t set up explicitly as a convergence center, although that space functioned as an informal hang-out and meeting spot. Initiatives such as the Anarchist World&#8217;s Fair encouraged anarchists to come early, and events ranging from the academic &#8220;Life After Capitalism&#8221; to the down and dirty &#8220;Really Really Free Market&#8221; heightened the energy in the air. The RNC was a grand experiment: everything was completely decentralized. As the communique delivered by the NYC Anarchist Grapevine said, &#8220;We should all finally face it - there is no Big Plan.&#8221; Just show up and see what was going down, or organize something yourself.that was the zeitgeist. Beautiful maps of New York City featuring multi-racial kissing pirates, subway stops, and corporate targets were provided a la carte.</p>\n<p>As the dates of the RNC drew nearer, some were getting butterflies in their collective stomachs about this lack of concrete action plans. One advantage of openly decentralizing the action plans was that many groups creatively called for autonomous actions: the &#8220;Mouse Bloc&#8221; and &#8220;Chaos on Broadway&#8221; call to interrupt the delegates as they watched Broadway shows, the humorous &#8220;Man in Black Bloc&#8221; call to reclaim Johnny Cash from the Republicans, and a host of increasingly surreal calls like the &#8220;Viking Bloc&#8221; were all examples of this. While this decentralized model opened space for autonomous action, it was unclear if the maturity and vision to plan even a single fully realized, effective decentralized action existed anywhere. The lack of a central spokescouncil prevented incompetent groups from taking control and instead invested faith in the people themselves, which is an inherently anarchist strategy for success; however, the fact of the matter was that while many were empowered, many coming in from out of town were bewildered. Most had neither the experience nor the time to organize their own direct actions or even navigate New York City properly. This enabled authoritarian groups that organize behind closed doors to take center stage with their plans to march everyone aimlessly around - you guessed it - in circles.</p>\n<p>Predictably, they called for a large permitted march to go right by the Republican National Convention&#8217;s location at Madison Square Garden. The march was to take place on Sunday, before the Convention even began, in order to maximize turnout and minimize possible conflict with the State. As one right wing website put it, &#8220;If this is the best the Revolution has to offer, the Establishment is safe.&#8221; Monday was reserved for not only one, but two, three, many Poor People&#8217;s Marches. Then out of nowhere, a group of West Coast activists parachuted in with the help of the usual suspects.the activists known during the RNC 2000 debacle as the Direct Action Network.to plan massive nonviolent civil disobedience in New York on Tuesday, hoping to repeat a success like the anti-war demonstrations in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The unprecedented decentralization of the RNC protests was perhaps the only way to organize in the chaos that is New York City, yet it left protesters with a schedule of events curiously similar to the Philly 2000 RNC protests. In fact, the schedule was almost exactly the same, down to the very days of the week. As experience has shown us consistently, anyone who suggests that protesters should divide their forces over a few days, with each day being reserved for one special type of protest, is a danger to all. Such a strategy always pans out in this way: on the first day of protest, usually a Sunday, there is a big march of a supposedly broad-based coalition, and the limits of this march are controlled by a small hierarchical group. Since these liberal and Marxist groups usually are well-funded, they can bring in bus-loads of people to march with them; they generally use the opportunity to hand-out mass-produced signs, sell newspapers, and bore people senseless with an endless array of carefully selected speakers. Most people leave town immediately after the big march is over. The next day, often a Monday, the various poor people&#8217;s marches begin, usually being mostly local people of color groups. Since poor people are inherently more dangerous to the State than liberals marching around in circles, they get hassled or attacked by the police. Anarchists support both of these marches and join in them, creating infrastructure and support work often for both. On the last day of action - a Tuesday - people interested in direct action are finally permitted to take the reigns, but in complete isolation. They take to the streets by themselves and, having announcing their plans all over the Internet, are quickly arrested and brutalized by the police. Now that many of us have experienced this way of scheduling protests several times, it&#8217;s hard not to see it as a sign of either sub-human intelligence or collaboration with the State - but in this aspect the protests against the RNC 2004 appeared to ape those against the RNC 2000.</p>\n<p>After Seattle, everyone agreed that we couldn&#8217;t repeat that particular model, as the element of surprise was gone. However, while we have lost the element of surprise in massive demonstrations, the other crucial element of Seattle that can and should be repeated is synchronicity. The combination of well-coordinated organized lock-downs, massive and festive demonstrations that provided support for direct actions, and decentralized autonomous actions like squat take-overs and Black Blocs, all at the same time, is what made the Seattle protests impossible for the police to control. Whenever any of these elements is isolated, it will most likely fail. Our power lies in the ability of diverse groups to coordinate, each offering its strengths in mutually beneficial relationships with other groups that may be completely different in ideology and tactics. This is the true strength of any network-based anti-authoritarian movement. To declare a return to staid leftist marching under a unified banner as one faceless mass, or to proclaim that &#8220;militant Black Blocs&#8221; or &#8220;non-violent civil disobedience&#8221; is the one true tactical way forward.both of these approaches are ridiculous and potentially detrimental to what potential we have. Anarchists should set the stage, then do whatever it is they do best in conjunction with everyone else, all at the same time. It&#8217;s a simple recipe, yet it&#8217;s never really been repeated in the United States on a large scale since the IMF/World Bank protests in 2000.</p>\n<p>Many anarchists organizing for the RNC were veterans of Seattle and other successful anti-globalization protests, and were hoping that the RNC protests would follow such a model. Yet UFPJ, lest their good names be tarred with the taint of actual direct action, did their best so keep their march separate from the direct action and civil disobedience. In the vain hope that we could somehow make an alliance with them, many anarchists did not openly confront UFPJ. In reality, old-fashioned Leftist groups like the UFPJ leadership are taking advantage of all the hard work of the anarchists and then throwing them into the jaws of the State. Since many Marxist-Leninists and liberals, as well as the frightening &#8220;anarcho-liberals,&#8221; are career activists, they don&#8217;t actually want to change things - if they did, they&#8217;d be out of a job - so they naturally avoided any real disruption of the RNC.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, anarchists and others who were more interested in action sent out calls for direct actions. These included a giant critical mass organized by Time&#8217;s Up, a unified direct action and direct democracy &#8220;Don&#8217;t Just Vote Take Action&#8221; contingent in the UFPJ march, a &#8220;Mouse Bloc&#8221; to personally confront the delegates Sunday night, and the A31 call to - shut down the RNC - on Tuesday. The possibility that the massive numbers of the anti-war movement would join in with the direct action tactics of the anti-globalization movement was negated by the scheduling of events. However, despite the best attempts of the police, media, and liberals to demoralize and divide the protesters, including a few &#8220;radicals&#8221; like Todd Gitlin humorously showing their true colors by saying any protest would just play into the hands of the Republicans, it was clear that something big was going to happen.</p>\n<p>Things were heating up, and even UFPJ&#8217;s rhetoric took a turn to direct action as they were prevented from going to Central Park and instead forced to turn around and go to Union Square. Although the war of words over which symbolic goal would be reached was a bit humorous, Mayor Bloomberg and the powers that be were getting scared. In an act of high comedy, the City began offering discounts at shops and museums to protesters who signed an agreement to be peaceful. Obviously the mayor hoped to obscure the fact that many of the protesters were there primarily to act against capitalism. Had the Queen offered to give Boston Tea Party protesters some Nestea coupons in return for a promise of pacifism, would we still be swearing &#8220;God Save the Queen&#8221;? The media proclaimed that &#8220;Anarchy Inc.&#8221; was going to take down the city. In a special &#8220;leak&#8221; from the police, the media revealed fifty of the country&#8217;s leading anarchists, each with fifty loyal followers willing to sacrifice themselves for their leader (?!), were being trailed by individually assigned goon squads. Obviously, all the money in the newfound massive intelligence budgets of the NYPD and FBI can.t make up for their fundamental lack of human intelligence. Virtually no anarchists any of us know were actually trailed, except for those who have appeared on major television channels in the last few years as &#8220;anarchist&#8221; media spokespeople. We all know those people are not involved in direct action in reality, due to the nature of their roles as media spokespeople.</p>\n<p>In an effort to help turn the tide of fear, a media event was held entitled &#8220;Are You an Anarchist? The Answer May Surprise You.&#8221; The participants ranged from the preacher Father Frank Morales of St. Mark.s Place to Kazembe Balagoon, author of &#8220;Queering the X: James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and the Third World.&#8221; As Warcry reminded the media, the real violence is never caused by the demonstrators, but the capitalist system, which is busy destroying the foundations upon which all of life rests. Since neither candidate is in favor of abolishing capitalism, no matter who wins the election, we all lose. Starhawk ended the session by reminding the media that the President personally condones violence as our official foreign policy, which puts a few streets clogged by sit-downs and the possibility of a broken window into perspective.\nThe Protest that Never Sleeps\nThe protests began in earnest on Thursday with an upbeat touch, as the RNC2DNC march arrived from the Democratic National Convention in Boston wearing Zapatista masks, breaking the law to bring the message of the Lacandon jungle home against the impressive backdrop of New York City&#8217;s glass-plated skyscrapers.</p>\n<p>Time&#8217;s Up! had been busy repairing bikes for weeks before the RNC. Their work set the stage for the great role bicycles played throughout the entire protest. On Friday night, the largest Critical Mass in NYC history seized the street in defiance of the terrifying environmental costs of this oil-driven civilization. Over five thousand bikers of all stripes and colors seized the streets for two hours, fouling up traffic in Manhattan and generally humiliating the police, who have never been able to control Critical Mass in NYC.</p>\n<p>As things wound down, the Critical Mass returned to St. Mark&#8217;s Church, and the cops attacked, targeting random bikers, breaking bones, and arresting anyone who tried to prevent them from doing so. In one telling moment, a few cops walked into the middle of St. Mark&#8217;s Church and arrested someone, even when they were surrounded by hundreds of protesters who could have stopped them. Still, for the most part the bikers managed to evade this repression and accomplish their goals. It was clear the battle was on, and the NYPD were playing for keeps. Instead of using the high-tech weaponry favored by police at Miami, the NYPD were going to rely on old-fashioned clubs, numbers, and beatdowns.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the UFPJ march slowly but surely gathered in the streets. Earlier, when the permit for the rally in Central Park had been denied, there had been rumors that people were going to try to march to Central Park anyway, regardless of what the UFPJ leadership said. While on many levels both possible destinations for the march were merely symbolic goals, marching to Central Park would have placed the march going right through Broadway around the time the Mouse Bloc was to confront the RNC delegates as they attended musicals. The feeling among local anarchists was that a giant Black Bloc at the march would have caused police to single us out for attack - in retrospect that might not have been the case, or even have been a bad thing if it had happened, but at the time anarchists from out of town took the advise of the locals seriously. To provide an alternative, the Don&#8217;t Just Vote Get Active campaign called for a &#8220;Unified Direct Democracy and Direct Action&#8221; contingent to deliver &#8220;a radical message to what otherwise might be a reformist event.&#8221; Gathering the Rhythm Workers Union and the Infernal Noise Brigade, the Pagans and the Greens, colorful hippies and black-clad anarcho-punks, pink-clad musicians and radical cheerleaders; this amalgamation grew into one of the largest and most festive contingents in the entire march.</p>\n<p>A huge Green Dragon of Self-Determination led the entire contingent, taking up almost an entire block. A small group of people with strange signs urging people to &#8220;disassemble the totality of power,&#8221; holding black umbrellas to hide themselves from the ever-present cameras filming on the tops of buildings, gathered behind the dragon. Others danced in front of the dragon, and the march seemed to be riding a crest of sheer joy as it approached Madison Square Garden, where the convention was to be held. At this juncture, right in front of the convention center, the sound system of the dragon finally ran out of batteries. In this opening, the Pagans began their inspiring Spiral Dance, and then, as Starhawk of the pagan cluster wrote, she felt &#8220;some powerful earth energy, a kind of raw life force that pulsed and thundered and rose up into a great, focused cone of power. Someone told me to look behind, and in the relatively empty space between us and the line of cops at 34th St., the dragon was burning.&#8221; The Green Dragon had burst into flames. Police retreated behind their barricades, and then gathered forces and began arresting people at random. A spontaneous Black Bloc appeared, defending themselves from the attacking police by throwing bottles as the flames raged behind them.</p>\n<p>To this day, no one knows exactly why the Green Dragon went up in smoke. I was dancing relatively near it and have no idea if it was a malfunction, a Pagan spell, an undercover Black Bloc using the Green Dragon as a Trojan Horse, or just some random act of madness. Regardless, in this downright surreal course of events, it became clear to me as the crowd fought back against the police assault that at least some people were bored of marching around aimlessly in circles and wanted to take militant direct action against the powers of the State. At one point, the cops even retreated from the crowd.</p>\n<p>We should be very careful about saying that anything is caused by &#8220;police provocateurs,&#8221; unless there is solid evidence. I remember groups like Ya Basta! floating the same accusations around Genoa against the Black Bloc. It&#8217;s always easy for protest organizers to call &#8220;police provocateurs&#8221; those militants who refuse to be corralled into their &#8220;organized&#8221; plans. While the burning dragon on strictly rational grounds made little sense except as a visceral manifestation of discontent, there was something fitting about a giant bonfire being set only a few yards from the castle of the self-proclaimed rulers of the world. If only the fire was on the inside!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the march turned dead around instead of forcing its way to Central Park. UFPJ marshals told the marchers to try to make their way to Central Park individually, in what could only feel like an anti-climax. Many anarchists and other angry citizens who weren&#8217;t already at Broadway went there to participate in the &#8220;Chaos on Broadway&#8221; and &#8220;Mouse Bloc&#8221; actions. This is where another phase in direct action began, one that fit almost perfectly the personality of New York City: small groups followed Republican delegates around New York and made their lives a living hell by being as rude as possible to them. On Broadway, I was greeted by an amazing sight: hundreds of protesters gathering in both large clumps and small clusters, undercover cops everywhere but seemingly unable to do anything, hundreds of ordinary tourists wandering about, and the cops generally losing control of the situation. As I walked out of the subway, I heard a girl scream as she fell, nearly wrapped in this strange orange mesh the cops were using to attempt to corral people, literally knocked off her feet by a cop.</p>\n<p>Generally, the rule seemed to be that groups of protesters who were wearing bandannas, holding up anti-Bush banners, or dressing in even more black than is usual in New York City, were targeted by the police and arrested as soon as they attempted to do anything even mildly illegal. The police even arrested the participants in a giant kiss-in. One can almost hear the officer saying, &#8220;We can&#8217;t have those queers kissing in public, it&#8217;s a threat to public order!&#8221; However, many protesters were dressed for the occasion, easily blending into the constant stream of tourists on Broadway. The cops were unable to arrest everybody, as the Republicans, protesters, and unsuspecting people passing by were mixed together. The protesters appeared as if by magic just where the Republicans were, as the Republicans could be easily identified by their blue tuxedos and red badges, as well as their pasty all-white faces and the gleam of greed and religious fundamentalism in their eyes.</p>\n<p>The organizational backbone of the whole event was the text messaging txtmob.org set up the Institute for Applied Autonomy. A network is only as powerful as its communications. Tactical information about the location of the police and the Republican delegates was sent out to hundreds of small groups of protesters, who used the information to gather and disperse quickly. It was the second coming of smart mobs, a fading trend given new life by a political objective.</p>\n<p>One of my friends nearly caused a delegate to choke him in anger by remarking how he would love to engage in homoerotic acts with said delegate. As the delegate removed his chokehold from my friend&#8217;s neck, my friend calmly stared him in the eyes and told him that &#8220;Your entire cock could fit inside my mouth.&#8221; At that moment, the delegate&#8217;s small mind cracked and he just lost whatever sanity he had left. Further down, a small bloc of anarchists terrified Republicans by blocking them with a black banner and chanting that &#8220;Right-wing scum, your time has come!&#8221; It was definitely not a pleasant night out on the town for the would-be masters of the universe. The arrogance of the Republican delegates was shocking: most of them didn&#8217;t even have security or bodyguards. I walked right up to one of them who looked like John McCain and told him he would wish that the Vietnamese had finished him off after what we Americans were going to do to him because of Iraq. I hope I had the right senator! Regardless, everywhere the delegates went there were both peace signs and fingers in the air, and the promise of &#8220;RNC Not Welcome&#8221; fulfilled itself, lasting hours until the cops finally managed to arrest several hundred people and the remaining protesters left tired but smiling.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the several Poor People&#8217;s Marches took place. I showed up at the Kensington Welfare Rights March to help a friend of mine manage a large &#8220;Boxing Bush&#8221; puppet, a life-sized effigy of Bush made especially for people to punch - the perfect puppet for inciting rowdy behavior in a crowd. I noticed a strange dynamic, as white middle-class activists told me to &#8220;stop causing trouble&#8221; and put our puppet away. While a white liberal told me I was distracting the gathered poor people from listening to yet another speaker, lots of people, especially kids, had a hell of a fun time punching the living daylights out of Bush. I wondered how the previous night&#8217;s events would have gone had we had some more of these people on the streets with us to hassle the Republicans. When the march finally got going, the true class war began, as police put on their riot gear. The cops were absolutely idiotic and reckless, harassing and arresting people just for dual crimes of marching and being poor. At another poor people&#8217;s march the police claim that an African-American protester gave an undercover a boot in the jaw. Quick point to remember: if the cops claim you assaulted a police officer and your face is on television, do not march around the next day in broad daylight. The police nabbed this man the next day. He&#8217;s the kind of guy we need to maintain solidarity with, even if he isn&#8217;t a card-carrying member of Anarchy Inc.</p>\n<p>The direct action plans for Tuesday originated as some strange plan for a coordinated primal scream. When I went to one of the planning spokescouncil meetings, they were passing around a flower to denote who was given the floor to speak. While I understand there are cultural differences between the East and West Coast, I somehow had difficulty imagining actual New Yorkers in that meeting. Still, when the day of action on Tuesday actually took place, it was impressive. Using the same text-messaging techniques employed successfully in the Broadway actions, large masses of people attempted to block intersections and hassle delegates, bringing large parts of Manhattan to a standstill. The police responded by arresting as many people as they could, as quickly as possible, with little regard to what they were actually doing or if any laws were being broken. At one point cops surrounded me and a friend with the dreaded orange netting. The orange netting was more of a psychological barrier than a physical one: riled up crowds sometimes broke through it. However, most of the crowd I was with didn&#8217;t even seem to notice that they were about to be mass-arrested. I walked calmly up to a cop, stared him straight in the eye, and said &#8220;You are not arresting me. I&#8217;m not a protester. Let me go.&#8221; The Jedi mind trick worked, and the cop meekly opened up the orange netting to let me and my friend out. Reports kept flooding in that people were sitting in the streets blocking traffic, and groups like the True Security Cluster did in fact seize a block occasionally.</p>\n<p>While the police were arresting people, things were getting out of hand. Some members of my affinity group managed to find themselves face to face with Barbara Bush and George Bush Sr., but the Secret Service arrived before we could effectively confront the former President. Meanwhile, one member of the People&#8217;s Law Collective went outside their office for a smoke break, and was pleasantly shocked to see piles of burning trash along Madison Avenue!\nThere&#8217;s a Song Beneath the Concrete\nIf anything, the RNC protests showed that domestic dissent is alive and well in the United States in the face of the creeping fascism of the Bush regime. This happened against overwhelming odds, and broke a spell of several years of bad luck. It had seemed that the anti-globalization was movement was in retreat since September 11th, unable to adapt its tactics and strategies to the new era of perpetual war and heavy repression. The large anti-globalization summit-protests seemed to be faltering and the anti-war protests ineffectual, with the harrowing nightmare of Miami was still fresh in many people&#8217;s minds. In the face of such odds, the RNC protests were a powerful showing of a popular uprising. They stole the media spotlight from the Republicans. The amount of new groups, new faces, and new alliances was overwhelming. Anarchist politics and culture have been kept alive, and a whole new generation is ready to commit their lives to the battle between people and power.</p>\n<p>This is a cultural triumph, since just five years ago at Seattle many anarchists felt purposefully excluded for their &#8220;too radical&#8221; political beliefs. Not only that, but anarchists are hip! A school-teacher friend of mine ran into kids in Queens who were debating the pros and cons of CrimethInc.&#8217;s &#8220;Evasion&#8221; and &#8220;Off the Map.&#8221; Besides being easily pigeon-holed into the doddering Black Bloc tradition, anarchists of all kinds, from the Radical Reference librarians to the squatters helping out Casa del Sol, were present everywhere. On every level, the direct action movement has shifted toward anarchist decentralized network models of organizing and action. The use of mobile phone technology to communicate tactical information via texting was put to great use. Dressing normally allowed anarchists to infiltrate Republican events.</p>\n<p>This was not a pro-Democrat protest: almost everyone I talked to there hated the Republicans but realized that the Democrats did not offer a real alternative. There was almost no pro-Kerry sentiment in evidence, and most protesters claimed that the entire system was bankrupt. More and more people are being drawn to an increasingly radical analysis of capitalism, from MTA workers to veterans back from Iraq. In the words of one paper anarchists distributed at the RNC, &#8220;It&#8217;s not Just Bush, It&#8217;s the System&#8221;!</p>\n<p>Why did anarchists let hierarchical groups like UFPJ direct events like the Sunday march from behind closed doors, when it was clear that those were the main body of the protests? Like it or not, if we truly believe that decisions should be open, democratic, and available to all, we can&#8217;t back down on that stance on the grounds that we need to make some sort of tactical alliance with liberals and crypto-leninists. Since it was anarchists who were doing much if not most of the actual work for the protests, we were in a position to tell UFPJ that they needed to open up their process and operate by at least a consensus-based spokescouncil; this might even have provoked a coup from within their grassroots membership, which is continually irritated at the sheer lack of backbone of their leadership. Often spokescouncils are just platforms for authoritarian cliques, yet as a forum a spokescouncil is better than none at all. After all, where else do we go to announce we are going to disagree with the plan, propose better plans, and meet our friends from out of town?</p>\n<p>The authoritarian Left is not our friends: if anything, they are holding back the power of people everywhere to take action. We need to stop pandering to union hierarchies and washed-up Marxists. We can provide spaces for people to take as much action as they feel comfortable with, such as the Green, Yellow, and Red Zones did in the Quebec City anti-FTAA protests. We can build alliances with groups that matter like the poor people of the Bronx who fight against the system for survival everyday. Let&#8217;s not tolerate a conscious return to outdated tactics and organizing, even from those of supposedly &#8220;anarchist&#8221; backgrounds who backslide into retrograde Leninist and liberal behavior, as Chomksy did in pleading with people to vote for Kerry. Let&#8217;s keep up the prison support - Banno is still up on trumped-up felony charges for the burning puppet incident, and a movement is only as strong as its prisoner support is.</p>\n<p>One more concern is worth voicing - the attrition rate in our community. We anarchists are the most experienced wing of the direct action movement. The generation that gave us Seattle was built up out of nearly a decade of largely unsung valuable work within groups such as Earth First! and Anti-Racist Action - but where is the Seattle generation now? Far too many experienced anarchists have gone into early retirement, which is both ludicrous and pompous since the situation has only gotten more oppressive since September 11th, not less, and most of the world does not have the luxury to retire to a comfortable life-style of dumpster-diving, gardening, or writing theory. We have to be in the front lines until the day we die or win, spreading our collective knowledge so we can finally have a multi-generational movement of resistance in the United States.</p>\n<p>As anarchists, it&#8217;s not our job to lead by giving commands. We lead by being an inspiring example, and the RNC was an example. We need more heroic examples to show that resistance is possible. The vast majority of people are so caught up within this system of oppression and despair that they cannot imagine another way of life. We can show it is possible by building gardens in abandoned parking lots, by not letting police brutality go unpunished, by fighting police in the streets whenever their masters come to town. We need to show that the Republicans, the G8, the Empire - call it what you will - doesn&#8217;t rule the world, but that the power to reshape the world lies in their own hands. It is these demonstrations, in which people realize their own strength and apply it, that keep us inspired and still fighting. The liberals and the remnants of the old Left falsely posit themselves as &#8220;representatives&#8221; of the people in order to constrain the possible choices and actions of the people. This makes them functionally, if not ideologically, complicit with the forces of the state. We anarchists seek not to represent the people, for we know people can only represent themselves. If someone truly does not want to riot, if they truly want to march around in circles, we respect that choice. Still, judging from the numbers of people who were interested in taking action at the RNC, there is clear evidence this tendency towards action is back and growing. Even if the RNC protests seemed like only a small step, these are the small steps of an awakening giant.</p>\n<p>Where are the mysterious anarchists? You&#8217;ll find the mythical and dreaded anarchists, both facing off the cops in the streets and building infrastructure, working their fingers to the bone and risking it all for the greatest of stakes: freedom. We&#8217;re not superheroes, but ordinary people, dirty and tired, weary yet still smiling, toiling away at mind-numbing drudgery and acting with unbelievable heroism for the dignity of life. We all have the courage we need within us. We can feel it in our bones and in the soil. As Aresh and the folks working in the community gardens in the Bronx know all too well, the soil is still rich and fertile beneath the concrete skyscrapers of New York. All that is required is that we have the courage to break open the concrete. And in New York, I could almost hear the concrete breaking.</p>'

It was dark so I ended up just looking for tail lights and, well, I&#8217;m still alive. </p>\n<p>School is cancelled again today because of the ice. I&#8217;m just laying in bed with my laptop. Quite enjoyable, actually. It doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll be driving anywhere today (not quite ready to die yet).</p>'

You actually get about two or three hours of special features on the second disk, which is pretty cool. One thing I have to comment on is the <i>Get Me an Exit</i> feature, which was actually a making of the commercials (Heinekin, Samsung Phone and TV, and Power-Aid). Was this really necessary? I mean, the commercials are crap (as are all commercials). Do I really need to see how they're made?

If you didn't like it in the theatre, you probably won't like it on the DVD. Although, I must recommend at least renting it so you can replay the end and try to figure out just <i>what</i> exactly the Architect says.
